be few.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5818">7</sup> And
this he said about Judah:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hear, O LORD, the cry of Judah;<br>

Meribah.<br>

father and mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I have no regard for them.’<br>

precepts to Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your law to Israel.<br>
He offers incense before you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whole burnt offerings on your altar.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5822">11</sup> Bless all his
skills, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be pleased with the work of his hands.<br>
Smite the loins of those who rise up against him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strike his foes till they rise no more.”</p>

hills;<br>

gifts of the earth and its fullness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning

"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> his brothers.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5828">17</sup> In majesty he
is like a firstborn bull;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his horns are the horns of a wild ox.<br>

Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim;<br>

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5832">21</sup> He chose the
best land for himself;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the leader’s portion was kept for him.<br>
