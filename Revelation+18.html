<h4>Revelation 18</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Fall of Babylon</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30979">1</sup> After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30980">2</sup> With a mighty voice he shouted: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has become a home for demons <br />and a haunt for every evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30980a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> spirit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30981">3</sup> For all the nations have drunk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the maddening wine of her adulteries. <br />The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30982">4</sup> Then I heard another voice from heaven say: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come out of her, my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that you will not share in her sins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that you will not receive any of her plagues; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30983">5</sup> for her sins are piled up to heaven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and God has remembered her crimes. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30984">6</sup> Give back to her as she has given; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay her back double for what she has done. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix her a double portion from her own cup. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30985">7</sup> Give her as much torture and grief <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the glory and luxury she gave herself. <br />In her heart she boasts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I sit as queen; I am not a widow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will never mourn.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30986">8</sup> Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, mourning and famine. <br />She will be consumed by fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30987">9</sup> “When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30988">10</sup> Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Woe! Woe, O great city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Babylon, city of power! <br />In one hour your doom has come!’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30989">11</sup> “The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30990">12</sup> cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30991">13</sup> cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30992">14</sup> “They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30993">15</sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30994">16</sup> and cry out: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Woe! Woe, O great city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30995">17</sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30996">18</sup> When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30997">19</sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Woe! Woe, O great city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where all who had ships on the sea <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became rich through her wealth! <br />In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30998">20</sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! <br />God has judged her for the way she treated you.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30999">21</sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With such violence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never to be found again. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31000">22</sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never be heard in you again. <br />No workman of any trade <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will ever be found in you again. <br />The sound of a millstone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never be heard in you again. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31001">23</sup> The light of a lamp <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never shine in you again. <br />The voice of bridegroom and bride <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never be heard in you again. <br />Your merchants were the world’s great men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By your magic spell all the nations were led astray. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31002">24</sup> In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of all who have been killed on the earth.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30980a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30980" title="Ir a Revelation 18:2">Revelation 18:2</a> Greek <i>unclean</i></li>
