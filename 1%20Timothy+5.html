<h5 class="passage-header">Advice About Widows, Elders and
Slaves</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29749">1</sup> Do not
rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your
father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29750">2</sup> older women as mothers, and younger
women as sisters, with absolute purity.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29751">3</sup> Give
proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29752">4</sup> But if a widow
has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to
put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and
so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to
God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29753">5</sup> The widow
who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and
continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29754">6</sup> But the widow
who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29755">7</sup> Give the people these
instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29756">8</sup> If anyone does not provide
for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has
denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29757">9</sup> No
widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty,
has been faithful to her husband,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29757a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29758">10</sup> and is well
known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing
hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in
trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29759">11</sup> As
for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their
sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to
marry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29760">12</sup> Thus
they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their
first pledge. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29761">13</sup>
Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from
house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also
gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29762">14</sup> So I counsel
younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes
and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29763">15</sup> Some have in fact already
turned away to follow Satan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29764">16</sup> If
any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should
help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the
church can help those widows who are really in need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29765">17</sup> The
elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of
double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and
teaching. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29766">18</sup> For
the Scripture says, “Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out
the grain,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29766b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and “The worker deserves his
wages.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29766c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29767">19</sup> Do not entertain an accusation against
an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29768">20</sup> Those who sin
are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take
warning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29769">21</sup> I
charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect
angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do
nothing out of favoritism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29770">22</sup> Do
not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the
sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29771">23</sup> Stop
drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach
and your frequent illnesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29772">24</sup> The
sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead
of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29773">25</sup> In the same way, good
deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be
hidden.</p>
