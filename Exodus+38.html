<h4>Exodus 38</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Altar of Burnt Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2635">1</sup>
They<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2635a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> built the altar of burnt offering
of acacia wood, three cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2635b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> high;
it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2635c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2636">2</sup> They made a horn at each of the four
corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and
they overlaid the altar with bronze. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2637">3</sup> They made all its utensils of bronze—its
pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2638">4</sup> They made a
grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge,
halfway up the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2639">5</sup> They cast bronze rings to hold the poles
for the four corners of the bronze grating. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2640">6</sup> They made the poles of acacia wood and
overlaid them with bronze. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2641">7</sup> They inserted the poles into the rings so
they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made
it hollow, out of boards.
<h5 class="passage-header">Basin for Washing</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2642">8</sup> They made
the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women
who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Courtyard</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2643">9</sup> Next they
made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2643d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> long and had curtains of finely
twisted linen, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2644">10</sup>
with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks
and bands on the posts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2645">11</sup> The north side was also a hundred cubits
long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver
hooks and bands on the posts.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2646">12</sup> The
west end was fifty cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2646e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> wide
and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks
and bands on the posts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2647">13</sup> The east end, toward the sunrise, was
also fifty cubits wide. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2648">14</sup> Curtains fifteen cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2648f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> long were on one side of the
entrance, with three posts and three bases, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2649">15</sup> and curtains fifteen cubits long were
on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three
posts and three bases. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2650">16</sup> All the curtains around the courtyard
were of finely twisted linen. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2651">17</sup> The bases for the posts were bronze. The
hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were
overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver
bands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2652">18</sup> The
curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was of blue, purple and
scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer.
It was twenty cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2652g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> long
and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2652h" title=
"Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> high, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2653">19</sup> with four posts and four bronze bases.
Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid
with silver. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2654">20</sup>
All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding
courtyard were bronze.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Materials Used</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2655">21</sup> These are
the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the
tabernacle of the Testimony, which were recorded at Moses’ command
by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the
priest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2656">22</sup>
(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made
everything the LORD commanded Moses; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2657">23</sup> with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach,
of the tribe of Dan—a craftsman and designer, and an embroiderer in
blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.) <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2658">24</sup> The total amount of the
gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary
was 29 talents and 730 shekels,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2658i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup>
according to the sanctuary shekel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2659">25</sup> The
silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the
census was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2659j" title=
"Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> according to the sanctuary shekel—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2660">26</sup> one beka per
person, that is, half a shekel,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2660k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup>
according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed
over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550
men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2661">27</sup> The 100
talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2661l" title=
"Vea nota al pie l">l</a>]</sup> of silver were used to cast the
bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100
talents, one talent for each base. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2662">28</sup> They used the 1,775 shekels<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2662m" title=
"Vea nota al pie m">m</a>]</sup> to make the hooks for the posts,
to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2663">29</sup> The
bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400
shekels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2663n" title=
"Vea nota al pie n">n</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2664">30</sup> They used it to make the bases for the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze
grating and all its utensils, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2665">31</sup> the bases for the surrounding courtyard
and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle
and those for the surrounding courtyard.</p>
