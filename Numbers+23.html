<h4>Numbers 23</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Balaam’s First Oracle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4418">1</sup> Balaam
said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and
seven rams for me.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4419">2</sup> Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of
them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4420">3</sup> Then
Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go
aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he
reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren
height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4421">4</sup> God met
with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on
each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4422">5</sup> The
LORD put a message in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak
and give him this message.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4423">6</sup> So he
went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with
all the princes of Moab. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4424">7</sup> Then Balaam uttered his oracle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Balak brought me from Aram,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king of Moab from the eastern mountains.<br>
‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, denounce Israel.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4425">8</sup> How can I
curse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom God has not cursed?<br>
How can I denounce<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom the LORD has not denounced?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4426">9</sup> From the rocky
peaks I see them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the heights I view them.<br>
I see a people who live apart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not consider themselves one of the
nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4427">10</sup> Who can count
the dust of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or number the fourth part of Israel?<br>
Let me die the death of the righteous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may my end be like theirs!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4428">11</sup> Balak
said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse
my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4429">12</sup> He
answered, “Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Balaam’s Second Oracle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4430">13</sup> Then
Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see
them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there,
curse them for me.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4431">14</sup> So he took him to the field of Zophim on
the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a
bull and a ram on each altar.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4432">15</sup> Balaam
said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with
him over there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4433">16</sup> The
LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, “Go
back to Balak and give him this message.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4434">17</sup> So he
went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the
princes of Moab. Balak asked him, “What did the LORD say?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4435">18</sup> Then
he uttered his oracle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Arise, Balak, and listen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear me, son of Zippor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4436">19</sup> God is not a
man, that he should lie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor a son of man, that he should change his
mind.<br>
Does he speak and then not act?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he promise and not fulfill?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4437">20</sup> I have received
a command to bless;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has blessed, and I cannot change it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4438">21</sup> “No
misfortune is seen in Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no misery observed in Israel.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4438a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
The LORD their God is with them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shout of the King is among them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4439">22</sup> God brought
them out of Egypt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have the strength of a wild ox.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4440">23</sup> There is no
sorcery against Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no divination against Israel.<br>
It will now be said of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4441">24</sup> The people rise
like a lioness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they rouse themselves like a lion<br>
that does not rest till he devours his prey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drinks the blood of his victims.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4442">25</sup> Then
Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at
all!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4443">26</sup> Balaam
answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD
says?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Balaam’s Third Oracle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4444">27</sup> Then
Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place.
Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from
there.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4445">28</sup> And
Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4446">29</sup> Balaam
said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and
seven rams for me.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4447">30</sup> Balak did as Balaam had said, and
offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>
