<p><h4>Hosea 10</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22227">1</sup> Israel was a spreading vine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brought forth fruit for himself. <br />As his fruit increased, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he built more altars; <br />as his land prospered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he adorned his sacred stones. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22228">2</sup> Their heart is deceitful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and now they must bear their guilt. <br />The LORD will demolish their altars <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy their sacred stones. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22229">3</sup> Then they will say, “We have no king <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because we did not revere the LORD. <br />But even if we had a king, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what could he do for us?” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22230">4</sup> They make many promises, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take false oaths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make agreements; <br />therefore lawsuits spring up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22231">5</sup> The people who live in Samaria fear <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22231a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />Its people will mourn over it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so will its idolatrous priests, <br />those who had rejoiced over its splendor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it is taken from them into exile. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22232">6</sup> It will be carried to Assyria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as tribute for the great king. <br />Ephraim will be disgraced; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22232b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22233">7</sup> Samaria and its king will float away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a twig on the surface of the waters. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22234">8</sup> The high places of wickedness<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22234c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> will be destroyed— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is the sin of Israel. <br />Thorns and thistles will grow up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cover their altars. <br />Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the hills, “Fall on us!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22235">9</sup> “Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there you have remained.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22235d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <br />Did not war overtake <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the evildoers in Gibeah? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22236">10</sup> When I please, I will punish them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nations will be gathered against them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to put them in bonds for their double sin. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22237">11</sup> Ephraim is a trained heifer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that loves to thresh; <br />so I will put a yoke <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on her fair neck. <br />I will drive Ephraim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah must plow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jacob must break up the ground. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22238">12</sup> Sow for yourselves righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reap the fruit of unfailing love, <br />and break up your unplowed ground; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it is time to seek the LORD, <br />until he comes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and showers righteousness on you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22239">13</sup> But you have planted wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have reaped evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have eaten the fruit of deception. <br />Because you have depended on your own strength <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on your many warriors, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22240">14</sup> the roar of battle will rise against your people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that all your fortresses will be devastated— <br />as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22241">15</sup> Thus will it happen to you, O Bethel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because your wickedness is great. <br />When that day dawns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king of Israel will be completely destroyed. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22231a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22231" title="Go to Hosea 10:5">Hosea 10:5</a> <i>Beth Aven</i> means <i>house of wickedness</i> (a name for Bethel, which means <i>house of God</i>).</li>
