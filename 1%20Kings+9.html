<h4>1 Kings 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The LORD Appears to Solomon</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9053">1</sup> When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9054">2</sup> the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9055">3</sup> The LORD said to him: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9056">4</sup> “As for you, if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9057">5</sup> I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9058">6</sup> “But if you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9058a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9058b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and go off to serve other gods and worship them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9059">7</sup> then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9060">8</sup> And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9061">9</sup> People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.’” <h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Other Activities</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9062">10</sup> At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the LORD and the royal palace— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9063">11</sup> King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9064">12</sup> But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9065">13</sup> “What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?” he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9065c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> a name they have to this day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9066">14</sup> Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9066d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of gold. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9067">15</sup> Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD’s temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9067e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9068">16</sup> (Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9069">17</sup> And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9070">18</sup> Baalath, and Tadmor<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9070f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> in the desert, within his land, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9071">19</sup> as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9071g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup>—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9072">20</sup> All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites), <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9073">21</sup> that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9073h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup>—these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9074">22</sup> But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9075">23</sup> They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon’s projects—550 officials supervising the men who did the work. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9076">24</sup> After Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the supporting terraces. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9077">25</sup> Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9077i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9078">26</sup> King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9078j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9079">27</sup> And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9080">28</sup> They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9080k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-9058a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-9058" title="Ir a 1 Kings 9:6">1 Kings 9:6</a> The Hebrew is plural.</li>
