<h4>2 Chronicles 1</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Solomon Asks for Wisdom</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11196">1</sup> Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11197">2</sup> Then Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11198">3</sup> and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD’s servant had made in the desert. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11199">4</sup> Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11200">5</sup> But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11201">6</sup> Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11202">7</sup> That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11203">8</sup> Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11204">9</sup> Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11205">10</sup> Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11206">11</sup> God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11207">12</sup> therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11208">13</sup> Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11209">14</sup> Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11209a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11210">15</sup> The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11211">16</sup> Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11211b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and from Kue<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11211c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11212">17</sup> They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11212d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11212e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-11209a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-11209" title="Ir a 2 Chronicles 1:14">2 Chronicles 1:14</a> Or <i>charioteers</i></li>
