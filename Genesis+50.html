<h4>Genesis 50</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1508">1</sup> Joseph
threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1509">2</sup> Then Joseph
directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel.
So the physicians embalmed him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1510">3</sup> taking a full forty days, for that was
the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him
seventy days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1511">4</sup> When
the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court,
“If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell
him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1512">5</sup> ‘My father
made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the
tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and
bury my father; then I will return.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1513">6</sup> Pharaoh
said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1514">7</sup> So
Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials
accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the
dignitaries of Egypt— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1515">8</sup> besides all the members of Joseph’s
household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s
household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left
in Goshen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1516">9</sup>
Chariots and horsemen<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1516a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> also
went up with him. It was a very large company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1517">10</sup> When
they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they
lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day
period of mourning for his father. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1518">11</sup> When the Canaanites who lived there saw
the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The
Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why
that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1518b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1519">12</sup> So
Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1520">13</sup> They carried him to the land of
Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near
Mamre, which Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the
Hittite, along with the field. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1521">14</sup> After burying his father, Joseph
returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others
who had gone with him to bury his father.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph Reassures His Brothers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1522">15</sup> When
Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What
if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the
wrongs we did to him?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1523">16</sup> So they sent word to Joseph, saying,
“Your father left these instructions before he died: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1524">17</sup> ‘This is what you are to
say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the
wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive
the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their
message came to him, Joseph wept.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1525">18</sup> His
brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are
your slaves,” they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1526">19</sup> But
Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1527">20</sup> You intended to
harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now
being done, the saving of many lives. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1528">21</sup> So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide
for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly
to them.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Joseph</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1529">22</sup> Joseph
stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a
hundred and ten years <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1530">23</sup> and saw the third generation of
Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were
placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1530c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1531">24</sup> Then
Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will
surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the
land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1532">25</sup> And Joseph made the sons
of Israel swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your
aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1533">26</sup> So
Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they
embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
