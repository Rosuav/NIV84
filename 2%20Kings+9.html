<h4>2 Kings 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehu Anointed King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9758">1</sup> The
prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and
said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of
oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9759">2</sup> When you get there, look for Jehu son of
Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his
companions and take him into an inner room. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9760">3</sup> Then take the flask and pour the oil
on his head and declare, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint you
king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run; don’t delay!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9761">4</sup> So the
young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9762">5</sup> When he arrived, he found
the army officers sitting together. “I have a message for you,
commander,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For which of us?” asked Jehu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For you, commander,” he replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9763">6</sup> Jehu
got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on
Jehu’s head and declared, “This is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the LORD’s people Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9764">7</sup> You are to
destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood
of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD’s
servants shed by Jezebel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9765">8</sup> The whole house of Ahab will perish. I
will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9766">9</sup> I will make the
house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the
house of Baasha son of Ahijah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9767">10</sup> As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on
the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’” Then he
opened the door and ran.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9768">11</sup> When
Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, “Is
everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You know the man and the sort of things he
says,” Jehu replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9769">12</sup>
“That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehu said, “Here is what he told me: ‘This is
what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9770">13</sup> They
hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare
steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9771">14</sup> So Jehu
son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
(Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against
Hazael king of Aram, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9772">15</sup> but King Joram<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9772a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> had returned to Jezreel to recover
from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle
with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, “If this is the way you feel,
don’t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in
Jezreel.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9773">16</sup> Then
he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was
resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9774">17</sup> When
the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops
approaching, he called out, “I see some troops coming.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to
meet them and ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9775">18</sup> The
horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king
says: ‘Do you come in peace?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you have to do with peace?” Jehu
replied. “Fall in behind me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lookout reported, “The messenger has
reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9776">19</sup> So the
king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said,
“This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with
peace? Fall in behind me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9777">20</sup> The
lookout reported, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back
either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi—he drives
like a madman.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9778">21</sup> “Hitch
up my chariot,” Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram
king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own
chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had
belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9779">22</sup> When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you
come in peace, Jehu?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How can there be peace,” Jehu replied, “as
long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel
abound?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9780">23</sup> Joram
turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery,
Ahaziah!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9781">24</sup> Then
Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow
pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9782">25</sup> Jehu said to Bidkar, his
chariot officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the field that
belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were
riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD
made this prophecy about him: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9783">26</sup> ‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and
the blood of his sons, declares the LORD, and I will surely make
you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the
LORD.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9783b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Now then, pick him up and throw
him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9784">27</sup> When
Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to
Beth Haggan.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9784c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> Jehu chased him, shouting,
“Kill him too!” They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to
Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9785">28</sup> His servants
took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in
his tomb in the City of David. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9786">29</sup> (In the eleventh year of Joram son of
Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jezebel Killed</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9787">30</sup> Then Jehu
went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she painted her eyes,
arranged her hair and looked out of a window. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9788">31</sup> As Jehu entered the gate, she asked,
“Have you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your
master?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9788d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9789">32</sup> He
looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?”
Two or three eunuchs looked down at him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9790">33</sup> “Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they
threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the
horses as they trampled her underfoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9791">34</sup> Jehu
went in and ate and drank. “Take care of that cursed woman,” he
said, “and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9792">35</sup> But when they went out to
bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her
hands. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9793">36</sup> They
went back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of the LORD
that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot
of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9793e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9794">37</sup> Jezebel’s body will be like refuse on
the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to
say, ‘This is Jezebel.’”</p>
