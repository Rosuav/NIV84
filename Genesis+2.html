<h4>Genesis 2</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-32">1</sup> Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-33">2</sup> By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-33a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> from all his work. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-34">3</sup> And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. <h5 class="passage-header">Adam and Eve</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-35">4</sup> This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-36">5</sup> and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-36b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-36c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and there was no man to work the ground, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-37">6</sup> but streams<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-37d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-38">7</sup> the LORD God formed the man<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-38e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-39">8</sup> Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-40">9</sup> And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-41">10</sup> A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-42">11</sup> The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-43">12</sup> (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-43f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> and onyx are also there.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-44">13</sup> The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-44g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-45">14</sup> The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-46">15</sup> The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-47">16</sup> And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-48">17</sup> but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-49">18</sup> The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-50">19</sup> Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-51">20</sup> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Adam<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-51h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> no suitable helper was found. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-52">21</sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-52i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> and closed up the place with flesh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-53">22</sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-53j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-54">23</sup> The man said, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is now bone of my bones <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flesh of my flesh; <br />she shall be called ‘woman,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-54k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup>’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she was taken out of man.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-55">24</sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-56">25</sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-33a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-33" title="Ir a Genesis 2:2">Genesis 2:2</a> Or <i>ceased</i>; also in verse 3</li>
