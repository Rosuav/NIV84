<h4>Nehemiah 6</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Further Opposition to the Rebuilding</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12403">1</sup> When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12404">2</sup> Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12404a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> on the plain of Ono.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were scheming to harm me; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12405">3</sup> so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12406">4</sup> Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12407">5</sup> Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12408">6</sup> in which was written: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12408b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12409">7</sup> and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12410">8</sup> I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12411">9</sup> They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12412">10</sup> One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12413">11</sup> But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12414">12</sup> I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12415">13</sup> He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12416">14</sup> Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me. <h5 class="passage-header">The Completion of the Wall</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12417">15</sup> So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12418">16</sup> When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12419">17</sup> Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12420">18</sup> For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12421">19</sup> Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-12404a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-12404" title="Ir a Nehemiah 6:2">Nehemiah 6:2</a> Or <i>in Kephirim</i></li>
