<p><h4>Acts 24</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Trial Before Felix</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27758">1</sup> Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27759">2</sup> When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27760">3</sup> Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27761">4</sup> But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27762">5</sup> “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27763">6</sup> and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27764">8</sup> By<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27764a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27765">9</sup> The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27766">10</sup> When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27767">11</sup> You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27768">12</sup> My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27769">13</sup> And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27770">14</sup> However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27771">15</sup> and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27772">16</sup> So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27773">17</sup> “After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27774">18</sup> I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27775">19</sup> But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27776">20</sup> Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27777">21</sup> unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27778">22</sup> Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27779">23</sup> He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27780">24</sup> Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27781">25</sup> As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27782">26</sup> At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27783">27</sup> When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-27764a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-27764" title="Go to Acts 24:8">Acts 24:8</a> Some manuscripts <i>him and wanted to judge him according to our law. 7 But the commander, Lysias, came and with the use of much force snatched him from our hands 8 and ordered his accusers to come before you.
