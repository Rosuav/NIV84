<p><h4>Mark 7</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Clean and Unclean</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24462">1</sup> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24463">2</sup> saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were “unclean,” that is, unwashed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24464">3</sup> (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24465">4</sup> When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24465a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24466">5</sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with ‘unclean’ hands?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24467">6</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘These people honor me with their lips,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>but their hearts are far from me.</font> <br /><font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24468">7</sup> They worship me in vain;</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>their teachings are but rules taught by men.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24468b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24469">8</sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24470">9</sup> And he said to them: <font class='woj'>“You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24470c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> your own traditions!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24471">10</sup> For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24471d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and, ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24471e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24472">11</sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: ‘Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24473">12</sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24474">13</sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24475">14</sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <font class='woj'>“Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24476">15</sup> Nothing outside a man can make him ‘unclean’ by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him ‘unclean.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24476f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24477">17</sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24478">18</sup> “Are you so dull?”</font> he asked. <font class='woj'>“Don’t you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him ‘unclean’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24479">19</sup> For it doesn’t go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.”</font> (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods “clean.”) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24480">20</sup> He went on: <font class='woj'>“What comes out of a man is what makes him ‘unclean.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24481">21</sup> For from within, out of men’s hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24482">22</sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24483">23</sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man ‘unclean.’”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Faith of a Syrophoenician Woman</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24484">24</sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24484g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24485">25</sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24485h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24486">26</sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia.

Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24494">34</sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, <font class='woj'><i>“Ephphatha!”</i></font> (which means, <font class='woj'>“Be opened!”</font>). <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24495">35</sup> At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24496">36</sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24497">37</sup> People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24465a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24465" title="Go to Mark 7:4">Mark 7:4</a> Some early manuscripts <i>pitchers, kettles and dining couches</i></li>
