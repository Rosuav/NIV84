<h4>2 Chronicles 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11366">1</sup> When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11367">2</sup> Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11368">3</sup> When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11369">4</sup> the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11369a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11370">5</sup> She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11371">6</sup> But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11372">7</sup> How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11373">8</sup> Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11374">9</sup> Then she gave the king 120 talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11374b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11375">10</sup> (The men of Hiram and the men of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11375c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and precious stones. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11376">11</sup> The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11377">12</sup> King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country. <h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Splendor</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11378">13</sup> The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11378d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11379">14</sup> not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11380">15</sup> King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred bekas<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11380e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> of hammered gold went into each shield. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11381">16</sup> He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred bekas<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11381f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11382">17</sup> Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11383">18</sup> The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11384">19</sup> Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11385">20</sup> All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11386">21</sup> The king had a fleet of trading ships<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11386g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> manned by Hiram’s<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11386h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> men. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11387">22</sup> King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11388">23</sup> All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11389">24</sup> Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11390">25</sup> Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11390i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11391">26</sup> He ruled over all the kings from the River<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11391j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11392">27</sup> The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11393">28</sup> Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11393k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> and from all other countries. <h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Death</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11394">29</sup> As for the other events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11395">30</sup> Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11396">31</sup> Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-11369a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-11369" title="Ir a 2 Chronicles 9:4">2 Chronicles 9:4</a> Or <i>the ascent by which he went up to</i></li>
