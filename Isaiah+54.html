<p><h4>Isaiah 54</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Future Glory of Zion</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18725">1</sup> “Sing, O barren woman, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who never bore a child; <br />burst into song, shout for joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who were never in labor; <br />because more are the children of the desolate woman <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than of her who has a husband,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18726">2</sup> “Enlarge the place of your tent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretch your tent curtains wide, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not hold back; <br />lengthen your cords, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthen your stakes. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18727">3</sup> For you will spread out to the right and to the left; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your descendants will dispossess nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and settle in their desolate cities. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18728">4</sup> “Do not be afraid; you will not suffer shame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. <br />You will forget the shame of your youth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18729">5</sup> For your Maker is your husband— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty is his name— <br />the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is called the God of all the earth. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18730">6</sup> The LORD will call you back <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit— <br />a wife who married young, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only to be rejected,” says your God. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18731">7</sup> “For a brief moment I abandoned you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with deep compassion I will bring you back. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18732">8</sup> In a surge of anger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hid my face from you for a moment, <br />but with everlasting kindness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have compassion on you,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD your Redeemer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18733">9</sup> “To me this is like the days of Noah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. <br />So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never to rebuke you again. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18734">10</sup> Though the mountains be shaken <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hills be removed, <br />yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor my covenant of peace be removed,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD, who has compassion on you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18735">11</sup> “O afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will build you with stones of turquoise,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18735a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your foundations with sapphires.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18735b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18736">12</sup> I will make your battlements of rubies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your gates of sparkling jewels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all your walls of precious stones. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18737">13</sup> All your sons will be taught by the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and great will be your children’s peace. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18738">14</sup> In righteousness you will be established: <br />Tyranny will be far from you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will have nothing to fear. <br />Terror will be far removed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will not come near you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18739">15</sup> If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whoever attacks you will surrender to you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18740">16</sup> “See, it is I who created the blacksmith <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who fans the coals into flame <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forges a weapon fit for its work. <br />And it is I who have created the destroyer to work havoc; <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18741">17</sup> no weapon forged against you will prevail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. <br />This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this is their vindication from me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18735a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18735" title="Go to Isaiah 54:11">Isaiah 54:11</a> The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</li>
