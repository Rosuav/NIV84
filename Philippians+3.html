<h4>Philippians 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">No Confidence in the Flesh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29407">1</sup> Finally,
my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write
the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29408">2</sup> Watch
out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the
flesh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29409">3</sup> For it
is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of
God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the
flesh— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29410">4</sup> though I
myself have reasons for such confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put
confidence in the flesh, I have more: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29411">5</sup> circumcised on the eighth day, of the
people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in
regard to the law, a Pharisee; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29412">6</sup> as for zeal, persecuting the church; as
for legalistic righteousness, faultless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29413">7</sup> But
whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of
Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29414">8</sup> What is
more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing
greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have
lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29415">9</sup> and be found in
him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law,
but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that
comes from God and is by faith. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29416">10</sup> I want to know Christ and the power of
his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings,
becoming like him in his death, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29417">11</sup> and so, somehow, to attain to the
resurrection from the dead.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Pressing on Toward the Goal</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29418">12</sup> Not that
I have already obtained all this, or have already been made
perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus
took hold of me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29419">13</sup> Brothers, I do not consider myself yet
to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is
behind and straining toward what is ahead, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29420">14</sup> I press on toward the goal to win
the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29421">15</sup> All
of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on
some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29422">16</sup> Only let
us live up to what we have already attained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29423">17</sup> Join
with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of
those who live according to the pattern we gave you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29424">18</sup> For, as I have often told
you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies
of the cross of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29425">19</sup> Their destiny is destruction, their god
is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is
on earthly things. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29426">20</sup> But our citizenship is in heaven. And
we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29427">21</sup> who, by the
power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will
transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious
body.</p>
