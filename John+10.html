<p><h4>John 10</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Shepherd and His Flock</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26472">1</sup> <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26473">2</sup> The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26474">3</sup> The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26475">4</sup> When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26476">5</sup> But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26477">6</sup> Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26478">7</sup> Therefore Jesus said again, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26479">8</sup> All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26480">9</sup> I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26480a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> He will come in and go out, and find pasture.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26481">10</sup> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26482">11</sup> “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26483">12</sup> The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26484">13</sup> The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26485">14</sup> “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26486">15</sup> just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26487">16</sup> I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26488">17</sup> The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26489">18</sup> No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26490">19</sup> At these words the Jews were again divided. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26491">20</sup> Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26492">21</sup> But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” <h5 class="passage-header">The Unbelief of the Jews</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26493">22</sup> Then came the Feast of Dedication<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26493b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> at Jerusalem. It was winter, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26494">23</sup> and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26495">24</sup> The Jews gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26495c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> tell us plainly.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26496">25</sup> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father’s name speak for me,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26497">26</sup> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26498">27</sup> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26499">28</sup> I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26500">29</sup> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26500d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26501">30</sup> I and the Father are one.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26502">31</sup> Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26503">32</sup> but Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26504">33</sup> “We are not stoning you for any of these,” replied the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26505">34</sup> Jesus answered them, <font class='woj'>“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are gods’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26505e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26506">35</sup> If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26507">36</sup> what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26508">37</sup> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26509">38</sup> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26510">39</sup> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26511">40</sup> Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26512">41</sup> and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26513">42</sup> And in that place many believed in Jesus. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-26480a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-26480" title="Go to John 10:9">John 10:9</a> Or <i>kept safe</i></li>
