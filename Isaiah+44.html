<h4>Isaiah 44</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Israel the Chosen</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18535">1</sup> “But now listen, O Jacob, my servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, whom I have chosen. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18536">2</sup> This is what the LORD says— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who made you, who formed you in the womb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who will help you: <br />Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18537">3</sup> For I will pour water on the thirsty land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams on the dry ground; <br />I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my blessing on your descendants. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18538">4</sup> They will spring up like grass in a meadow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like poplar trees by flowing streams. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18539">5</sup> One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD’; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another will call himself by the name of Jacob; <br />still another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will take the name Israel. <h5 class="passage-header">The LORD, Not Idols</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18540">6</sup> “This is what the LORD says— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty: <br />I am the first and I am the last; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apart from me there is no God. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18541">7</sup> Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him declare and lay out before me <br />what has happened since I established my ancient people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what is yet to come— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, let him foretell what will come. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18542">8</sup> Do not tremble, do not be afraid. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? <br />You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18543">9</sup> All who make idols are nothing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the things they treasure are worthless. <br />Those who would speak up for them are blind; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are ignorant, to their own shame. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18544">10</sup> Who shapes a god and casts an idol, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which can profit him nothing? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18545">11</sup> He and his kind will be put to shame; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;craftsmen are nothing but men. <br />Let them all come together and take their stand; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be brought down to terror and infamy. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18546">12</sup> The blacksmith takes a tool <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and works with it in the coals; <br />he shapes an idol with hammers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he forges it with the might of his arm. <br />He gets hungry and loses his strength; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he drinks no water and grows faint. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18547">13</sup> The carpenter measures with a line <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes an outline with a marker; <br />he roughs it out with chisels <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and marks it with compasses. <br />He shapes it in the form of man, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of man in all his glory, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it may dwell in a shrine. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18548">14</sup> He cut down cedars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or perhaps took a cypress or oak. <br />He let it grow among the trees of the forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18549">15</sup> It is man’s fuel for burning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some of it he takes and warms himself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he kindles a fire and bakes bread. <br />But he also fashions a god and worships it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes an idol and bows down to it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18550">16</sup> Half of the wood he burns in the fire; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over it he prepares his meal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he roasts his meat and eats his fill. <br />He also warms himself and says, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18551">17</sup> From the rest he makes a god, his idol; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he bows down to it and worships. <br />He prays to it and says, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Save me; you are my god.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18552">18</sup> They know nothing, they understand nothing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their minds closed so they cannot understand. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18553">19</sup> No one stops to think, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, <br />“Half of it I used for fuel; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even baked bread over its coals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I roasted meat and I ate. <br />Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I bow down to a block of wood?” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18554">20</sup> He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart misleads him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he cannot save himself, or say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18555">21</sup> “Remember these things, O Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are my servant, O Israel. <br />I have made you, you are my servant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Israel, I will not forget you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18556">22</sup> I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your sins like the morning mist. <br />Return to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have redeemed you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18557">23</sup> Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shout aloud, O earth beneath. <br />Burst into song, you mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you forests and all your trees, <br />for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he displays his glory in Israel. <h5 class="passage-header">Jerusalem to Be Inhabited</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18558">24</sup> “This is what the LORD says— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the LORD, <br />who has made all things, <br />who alone stretched out the heavens, <br />who spread out the earth by myself, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18559">25</sup> who foils the signs of false prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes fools of diviners, <br />who overthrows the learning of the wise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turns it into nonsense, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18560">26</sup> who carries out the words of his servants <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the towns of Judah, ‘They shall be built,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of their ruins, ‘I will restore them,’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18561">27</sup> who says to the watery deep, ‘Be dry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will dry up your streams,’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18562">28</sup> who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will accomplish all that I please; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.”’ </div></body></html>
