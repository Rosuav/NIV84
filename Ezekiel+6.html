<p><h4>Ezekiel 6</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against the Mountains of Israel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20565">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20566">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20567">3</sup> and say: ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20568">4</sup> Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20569">5</sup> I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20570">6</sup> Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20571">7</sup> Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20572">8</sup> “‘But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20573">9</sup> Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20574">10</sup> And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20575">11</sup> “‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and plague. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20576">12</sup> He that is far away will die of the plague, and he that is near will fall by the sword, and he that survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I spend my wrath upon them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20577">13</sup> And they will know that I am the LORD, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20578">14</sup> And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20578a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>—wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20578a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20578" title="Go to Ezekiel 6:14">Ezekiel 6:14</a> Most Hebrew manuscripts; a few Hebrew manuscripts <i>Riblah</i></li>
