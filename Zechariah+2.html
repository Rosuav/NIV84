<h5 class="passage-header">A Man With a Measuring Line</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22901">1</sup> Then I
looked up—and there before me was a man with a measuring line in
his hand! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22902">2</sup> I
asked, “Where are you going?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find
out how wide and how long it is.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22903">3</sup> Then
the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel came to
meet him <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22904">4</sup> and
said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city
without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in
it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22905">5</sup> And I
myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I
will be its glory within.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22906">6</sup> “Come!
Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I
have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22907">7</sup> “Come,
O Zion! Escape, you who live in the Daughter of Babylon!”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22908">8</sup> For this is
what the LORD Almighty says: “After he has honored me and has sent
me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches
you touches the apple of his eye— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22909">9</sup> I will surely raise my hand against them
so that their slaves will plunder them.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22909a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Then you will know that the LORD
Almighty has sent me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22910">10</sup>
“Shout and be glad, O Daughter of Zion. For I am coming, and I will
live among you,” declares the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22911">11</sup> “Many nations will be joined with the
LORD in that day and will become my people. I will live among you
and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22912">12</sup> The LORD will
inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22913">13</sup> Be
still before the LORD, all mankind, because he has roused himself
from his holy dwelling.”</p>
