<p><h4>Mark 1</h4><h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24214">1</sup> The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24214a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24215">2</sup> It is written in Isaiah the prophet: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will send my messenger ahead of you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who will prepare your way”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24215b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>— <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24216">3</sup> “a voice of one calling in the desert, <br />‘Prepare the way for the Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make straight paths for him.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24216c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24217">4</sup> And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24218">5</sup> The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24219">6</sup> John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24220">7</sup> And this was his message: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24221">8</sup> I baptize you with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24221d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24222">9</sup> At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24223">10</sup> As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24224">11</sup> And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24225">12</sup> At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24226">13</sup> and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Calling of the First Disciples</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24227">14</sup> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24228">15</sup> “The time has come,”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24229">16</sup> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24230">17</sup> “Come, follow me,”</font> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“and I will make you fishers of men.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24231">18</sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24232">19</sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24233">20</sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24234">21</sup> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24235">22</sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24236">23</sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24236e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> spirit cried out, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24237">24</sup> “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24238">25</sup> “Be quiet!”</font> said Jesus sternly. <font class='woj'>“Come out of him!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24239">26</sup> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24240">27</sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24241">28</sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals Many</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24242">29</sup> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24243">30</sup> Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24244">31</sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24245">32</sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24246">33</sup> The whole town gathered at the door, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24247">34</sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24248">35</sup> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24249">36</sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24250">37</sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24251">38</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24252">39</sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <h5 class="passage-header">A Man With Leprosy</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24253">40</sup> A man with leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24253f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24254">41</sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <font class='woj'>“I am willing,”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“Be clean!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24255">42</sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24256">43</sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24257">44</sup> “See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24258">45</sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24214a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24214" title="Ir a Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</a> Some manuscripts do not have <i>the Son of God.</i></li>
