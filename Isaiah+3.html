<h4>Isaiah 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17709">1</sup> See now,
the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty,<br>
is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both supply and support:<br>
all supplies of food and all supplies of water,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17710">2</sup> the hero
and warrior,<br>
the judge and prophet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the soothsayer and elder,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17711">3</sup> the captain of
fifty and man of rank,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever
enchanter.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17712">4</sup> I will
make boys their officials;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mere children will govern them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17713">5</sup> People will
oppress each other—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man against man, neighbor against neighbor.<br>
The young will rise up against the old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the base against the honorable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17714">6</sup> A man
will seize one of his brothers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at his father’s home, and say,<br>
“You have a cloak, you be our leader;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take charge of this heap of ruins!”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17715">7</sup> But in that day
he will cry out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have no remedy.<br>
I have no food or clothing in my house;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not make me the leader of the people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17716">8</sup>
Jerusalem staggers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah is falling;<br>
their words and deeds are against the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defying his glorious presence.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17717">9</sup> The look on
their faces testifies against them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they parade their sin like Sodom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not hide it.<br>
Woe to them!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have brought disaster upon themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17718">10</sup> Tell
the righteous it will be well with them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17719">11</sup> Woe to the
wicked! Disaster is upon them!<br>
They will be paid back for what their hands have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17720">12</sup>
Youths oppress my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women rule over them.<br>
O my people, your guides lead you astray;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they turn you from the path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17721">13</sup> The
LORD takes his place in court;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he rises to judge the people.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17722">14</sup> The LORD
enters into judgment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the elders and leaders of his people:<br>
“It is you who have ruined my vineyard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the plunder from the poor is in your houses.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17723">15</sup> What do you
mean by crushing my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grinding the faces of the poor?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17724">16</sup> The
LORD says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The women of Zion are haughty,<br>
walking along with outstretched necks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flirting with their eyes,<br>
tripping along with mincing steps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with ornaments jingling on their ankles.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17725">17</sup> Therefore the
Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will make their scalps bald.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17726">18</sup> In
that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and
headbands and crescent necklaces, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17727">19</sup> the earrings and bracelets and veils,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17728">20</sup> the
headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and
charms, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17729">21</sup> the
signet rings and nose rings, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17730">22</sup> the fine robes and the capes and
cloaks, the purses <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17731">23</sup> and mirrors, and the linen garments and
tiaras and shawls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17732">24</sup>
Instead of fragrance there will be a stench;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of a sash, a rope;<br>
instead of well-dressed hair, baldness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of fine clothing, sackcloth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of beauty, branding.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17733">25</sup> Your men will
fall by the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your warriors in battle.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17734">26</sup> The gates of
Zion will lament and mourn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destitute, she will sit on the ground.</p>
