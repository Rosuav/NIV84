<p><h4>Jeremiah 9</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19177">1</sup> Oh, that my head were a spring of water <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my eyes a fountain of tears! <br />I would weep day and night <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the slain of my people. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19178">2</sup> Oh, that I had in the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lodging place for travelers, <br />so that I might leave my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and go away from them; <br />for they are all adulterers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a crowd of unfaithful people. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19179">3</sup> “They make ready their tongue <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a bow, to shoot lies; <br />it is not by truth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they triumph<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19179a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in the land. <br />They go from one sin to another; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not acknowledge me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19180">4</sup> “Beware of your friends; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not trust your brothers. <br />For every brother is a deceiver,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19180b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every friend a slanderer. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19181">5</sup> Friend deceives friend, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one speaks the truth. <br />They have taught their tongues to lie; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they weary themselves with sinning. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19182">6</sup> You<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19182c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> live in the midst of deception; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19183">7</sup> Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, I will refine and test them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what else can I do <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the sin of my people? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19184">8</sup> Their tongue is a deadly arrow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it speaks with deceit. <br />With his mouth each speaks cordially to his neighbor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in his heart he sets a trap for him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19185">9</sup> Should I not punish them for this?” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br />“Should I not avenge myself <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on such a nation as this?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19186">10</sup> I will weep and wail for the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take up a lament concerning the desert pastures. <br />They are desolate and untraveled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the lowing of cattle is not heard. <br />The birds of the air have fled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the animals are gone. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19187">11</sup> “I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a haunt of jackals; <br />and I will lay waste the towns of Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so no one can live there.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19188">12</sup> What man is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19189">13</sup> The LORD said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19190">14</sup> Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their fathers taught them.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19191">15</sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19192">16</sup> I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have destroyed them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19193">17</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send for the most skillful of them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19194">18</sup> Let them come quickly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wail over us <br />till our eyes overflow with tears <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and water streams from our eyelids. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19195">19</sup> The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘How ruined we are! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How great is our shame! <br />We must leave our land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because our houses are in ruins.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19196">20</sup> Now, O women, hear the word of the LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open your ears to the words of his mouth. <br />Teach your daughters how to wail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach one another a lament. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19197">21</sup> Death has climbed in through our windows <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has entered our fortresses; <br />it has cut off the children from the streets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the young men from the public squares. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19198">22</sup> Say, “This is what the LORD declares: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The dead bodies of men will lie <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like refuse on the open field, <br />like cut grain behind the reaper, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one to gather them.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19199">23</sup> This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the strong man boast of his strength <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the rich man boast of his riches, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19200">24</sup> but let him who boasts boast about this: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he understands and knows me, <br />that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justice and righteousness on earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for in these I delight,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19201">25</sup> “The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19202">26</sup> Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the desert in distant places.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19202d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-19179a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-19179" title="Go to Jeremiah 9:3">Jeremiah 9:3</a> Or <i>lies; / they are not valiant for truth</i></li>
