&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Of David.</b>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14301">1</sup> To you
I call, O LORD my Rock;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not turn a deaf ear to me.<br>
For if you remain silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be like those who have gone down to the
pit.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14302">2</sup> Hear my cry for
mercy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I call to you for help,<br>
as I lift up my hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward your Most Holy Place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14303">3</sup> Do not
drag me away with the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with those who do evil,<br>
who speak cordially with their neighbors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but harbor malice in their hearts.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14304">4</sup> Repay them for
their deeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for their evil work;<br>
repay them for what their hands have done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring back upon them what they deserve.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14305">5</sup> Since they show
no regard for the works of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what his hands have done,<br>
he will tear them down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and never build them up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14306">6</sup> Praise
be to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has heard my cry for mercy.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14307">7</sup> The LORD is my
strength and my shield;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.<br>
My heart leaps for joy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will give thanks to him in song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14308">8</sup> The
LORD is the strength of his people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14309">9</sup> Save your
people and bless your inheritance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be their shepherd and carry them forever.</p>
