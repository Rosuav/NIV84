<h4>Habakkuk 2</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22750">1</sup> I will
stand at my watch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and station myself on the ramparts;<br>
I will look to see what he will say to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what answer I am to give to this
complaint.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22750a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Answer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22751">2</sup> Then the
LORD replied:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Write down the revelation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make it plain on tablets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that a herald<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22751b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> may run
with it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22752">3</sup> For the
revelation awaits an appointed time;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it speaks of the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not prove false.<br>
Though it linger, wait for it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22752c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> will
certainly come and will not delay.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22753">4</sup> “See, he is
puffed up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his desires are not upright—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will live by his
faith<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22753d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22754">5</sup> indeed, wine
betrays him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is arrogant and never at rest.<br>
Because he is as greedy as the grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22754e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like death is never satisfied,<br>
he gathers to himself all the nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and takes captive all the peoples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22755">6</sup> “Will
not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes himself wealthy by extortion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long must this go on?’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22756">7</sup> Will not your
debtors<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22756f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> suddenly arise?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they not wake up and make you tremble?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you will become their victim.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22757">8</sup> Because you
have plundered many nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the peoples who are left will plunder you.<br>
For you have shed man’s blood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone
in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22758">9</sup> “Woe
to him who builds his realm by unjust gain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set his nest on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to escape the clutches of ruin!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22759">10</sup> You have
plotted the ruin of many peoples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shaming your own house and forfeiting your
life.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22760">11</sup> The stones of
the wall will cry out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22761">12</sup> “Woe
to him who builds a city with bloodshed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and establishes a town by crime!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22762">13</sup> Has not the
LORD Almighty determined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the people’s labor is only fuel for the
fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the nations exhaust themselves for
nothing?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22763">14</sup> For the earth
will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22764">15</sup> “Woe
to him who gives drink to his neighbors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pouring it from the wineskin till they are
drunk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he can gaze on their naked bodies.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22765">16</sup> You will be
filled with shame instead of glory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is your turn! Drink and be
exposed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22765g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>!<br>
The cup from the LORD’s right hand is coming around to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disgrace will cover your glory.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22766">17</sup> The violence
you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your destruction of animals will terrify
you.<br>
For you have shed man’s blood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone
in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22767">18</sup> “Of
what value is an idol, since a man has carved it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an image that teaches lies?<br>
For he who makes it trusts in his own creation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes idols that cannot speak.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22768">19</sup> Woe to him who
says to wood, ‘Come to life!’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’<br>
Can it give guidance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is covered with gold and silver;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no breath in it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22769">20</sup> But the LORD
is in his holy temple;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let all the earth be silent before him.”</p>
