<h4>Micah 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Leaders and Prophets Rebuked</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22610">1</sup> Then I
said,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you rulers of the house of Israel.<br>
Should you not know justice,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22611">2</sup> you who
hate good and love evil;<br>
who tear the skin from my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the flesh from their bones;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22612">3</sup> who eat my
people’s flesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strip off their skin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and break their bones in pieces;<br>
who chop them up like meat for the pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like flesh for the pot?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22613">4</sup> Then
they will cry out to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he will not answer them.<br>
At that time he will hide his face from them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the evil they have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22614">5</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As for the prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who lead my people astray,<br>
if one feeds them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they proclaim ‘peace’;<br>
if he does not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they prepare to wage war against him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22615">6</sup> Therefore night
will come over you, without visions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and darkness, without divination.<br>
The sun will set for the prophets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the day will go dark for them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22616">7</sup> The seers will
be ashamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the diviners disgraced.<br>
They will all cover their faces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because there is no answer from God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22617">8</sup> But as
for me, I am filled with power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Spirit of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with justice and might,<br>
to declare to Jacob his transgression,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Israel his sin.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22618">9</sup> Hear this, you
leaders of the house of Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you rulers of the house of Israel,<br>
who despise justice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and distort all that is right;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22619">10</sup> who build Zion
with bloodshed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jerusalem with wickedness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22620">11</sup> Her leaders
judge for a bribe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her priests teach for a price,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her prophets tell fortunes for money.<br>
Yet they lean upon the LORD and say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is not the LORD among us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No disaster will come upon us.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22621">12</sup> Therefore
because of you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zion will be plowed like a field,<br>
Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the temple hill a mound overgrown with
thickets.</p>
