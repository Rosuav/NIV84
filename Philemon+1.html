<h4>Philemon 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29924">1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29925">2</sup> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29926">3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving and Prayer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29927">4</sup> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29928">5</sup> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29929">6</sup> I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29930">7</sup> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. <h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Plea for Onesimus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29931">8</sup> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29932">9</sup> yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29933">10</sup> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29933a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> who became my son while I was in chains. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29934">11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29935">12</sup> I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29936">13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29937">14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29938">15</sup> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29939">16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29940">17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29941">18</sup> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29942">19</sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29943">20</sup> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29944">21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29945">22</sup> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29946">23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29947">24</sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29948">25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29933a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29933" title="Ir a Philemon 1:10">Philemon 1:10</a> <i>Onesimus</i> means <i>useful.</i></li>
