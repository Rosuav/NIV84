<p><h4>Jeremiah 30</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Restoration of Israel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19669">1</sup> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19670">2</sup> “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19671">3</sup> The days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19671a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and restore them to the land I gave their forefathers to possess,’ says the LORD.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19672">4</sup> These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19673">5</sup> “This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Cries of fear are heard— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terror, not peace. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19674">6</sup> Ask and see: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a man bear children? <br />Then why do I see every strong man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every face turned deathly pale? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19675">7</sup> How awful that day will be! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None will be like it. <br />It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he will be saved out of it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19676">8</sup> “‘In that day,’ declares the LORD Almighty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will break the yoke off their necks <br />and will tear off their bonds; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no longer will foreigners enslave them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19677">9</sup> Instead, they will serve the LORD their God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David their king, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I will raise up for them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19678">10</sup> “‘So do not fear, O Jacob my servant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not be dismayed, O Israel,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br />‘I will surely save you out of a distant place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your descendants from the land of their exile. <br />Jacob will again have peace and security, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one will make him afraid. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19679">11</sup> I am with you and will save you,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br />‘Though I completely destroy all the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among which I scatter you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not completely destroy you. <br />I will discipline you but only with justice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not let you go entirely unpunished.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19680">12</sup> “This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Your wound is incurable, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your injury beyond healing. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19681">13</sup> There is no one to plead your cause, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no remedy for your sore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no healing for you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19682">14</sup> All your allies have forgotten you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they care nothing for you. <br />I have struck you as an enemy would <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and punished you as would the cruel, <br />because your guilt is so great <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your sins so many. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19683">15</sup> Why do you cry out over your wound, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your pain that has no cure? <br />Because of your great guilt and many sins <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have done these things to you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19684">16</sup> “‘But all who devour you will be devoured; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all your enemies will go into exile. <br />Those who plunder you will be plundered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who make spoil of you I will despoil. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19685">17</sup> But I will restore you to health <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and heal your wounds,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br />‘because you are called an outcast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zion for whom no one cares.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19686">18</sup> “This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have compassion on his dwellings; <br />the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the palace will stand in its proper place. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19687">19</sup> From them will come songs of thanksgiving <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sound of rejoicing. <br />I will add to their numbers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will not be decreased; <br />I will bring them honor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will not be disdained. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19688">20</sup> Their children will be as in days of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their community will be established before me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will punish all who oppress them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19689">21</sup> Their leader will be one of their own; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their ruler will arise from among them. <br />I will bring him near and he will come close to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for who is he who will devote himself <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be close to me?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19690">22</sup> “‘So you will be my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will be your God.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19691">23</sup> See, the storm of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will burst out in wrath, <br />a driving wind swirling down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the heads of the wicked. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19692">24</sup> The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he fully accomplishes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the purposes of his heart. <br />In days to come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will understand this. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-19671a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-19671" title="Go to Jeremiah 30:3">Jeremiah 30:3</a> Or <i>will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah</i></li>
