<p><h4>Ezekiel 4</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20531">1</sup> “Now, son of man, take a clay tablet, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20532">2</sup> Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20533">3</sup> Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20534">4</sup> “Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20534a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20535">5</sup> I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20536">6</sup> “After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20537">7</sup> Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20538">8</sup> I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20539">9</sup> “Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20540">10</sup> Weigh out twenty shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20540b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of food to eat each day and eat it at set times. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20541">11</sup> Also measure out a sixth of a hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20541c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> of water and drink it at set times. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20542">12</sup> Eat the food as you would a barley cake; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20543">13</sup> The LORD said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20544">14</sup> Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20545">15</sup> “Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow manure instead of human excrement.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20546">16</sup> He then said to me: “Son of man, I will cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20547">17</sup> for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20547d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> their sin. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20534a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20534" title="Go to Ezekiel 4:4">Ezekiel 4:4</a> Or <i>your side</i></li>
