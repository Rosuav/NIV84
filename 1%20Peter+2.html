<div class="result-text-style-normal text-html">
<h4>1 Peter 2</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30385">1</sup>
Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy,
envy, and slander of every kind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30386">2</sup> Like newborn babies, crave pure
spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30387">3</sup> now that you
have tasted that the Lord is good.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Living Stone and a Chosen
People</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30388">4</sup> As you
come to him, the living Stone—rejected by men but chosen by God and
precious to him— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30389">5</sup> you also, like living stones, are being
built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30390">6</sup> For in
Scripture it says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, I lay a stone in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chosen and precious cornerstone,<br>
and the one who trusts in him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never be put to shame.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30390a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30391">7</sup> Now to
you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not
believe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The stone the builders rejected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the capstone,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30391b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30391c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30392">8</sup>
and,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A stone that causes men to stumble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a rock that makes them fall.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30392d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stumble because they disobey the
message—which is also what they were destined for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30393">9</sup> But
you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him
who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30394">10</sup> Once you were
not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not
received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30395">11</sup> Dear
friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to
abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30396">12</sup> Live such good
lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong,
they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits
us.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Submission to Rulers and Masters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30397">13</sup> Submit
yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every authority instituted among
men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30398">14</sup> or to governors, who are
sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who
do right. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30399">15</sup> For
it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant
talk of foolish men. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30400">16</sup> Live as free men, but do not use your
freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30401">17</sup> Show proper
respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God,
honor the king.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30402">18</sup>
Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not
only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who
are harsh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30403">19</sup> For
it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust
suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30404">20</sup> But how is it to your credit if you
receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer
for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30405">21</sup> To this you
were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an
example, that you should follow in his steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30406">22</sup> “He
committed no sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no deceit was found in his mouth.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30406e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30407">23</sup> When
they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he
suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him
who judges justly. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30408">24</sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on
the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness;
by his wounds you have been healed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30409">25</sup> For you were like sheep going astray,
but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your
souls.</p>
