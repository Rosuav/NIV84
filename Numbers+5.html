<h4>Numbers 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Purity of the Camp</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3794">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3795">2</sup>
“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has
an infectious skin disease<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3795a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> or a
discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a
dead body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3796">3</sup> Send
away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will
not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3797">4</sup> The Israelites did this;
they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had
instructed Moses.
<h5 class="passage-header">Restitution for Wrongs</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3798">5</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3799">6</sup>
“Say to the Israelites: ‘When a man or woman wrongs another in any
way<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3799b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and so is unfaithful to the LORD,
that person is guilty <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3800">7</sup> and must confess the sin he has
committed. He must make full restitution for his wrong, add one
fifth to it and give it all to the person he has wronged.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3801">8</sup> But if that
person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for
the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to
the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3802">9</sup> All the
sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong
to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3803">10</sup> Each
man’s sacred gifts are his own, but what he gives to the priest
will belong to the priest.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">The Test for an Unfaithful Wife</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3804">11</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3805">12</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: ‘If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3806">13</sup> by sleeping
with another man, and this is hidden from her husband and her
impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and
she has not been caught in the act), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3807">14</sup> and if feelings of jealousy come over
her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is
jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3808">15</sup> then he is to take his
wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an
ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3808c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of barley flour on her behalf. He
must not pour oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain
offering for jealousy, a reminder offering to draw attention to
guilt.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3809">16</sup> “‘The
priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3810">17</sup> Then he shall
take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the
tabernacle floor into the water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3811">18</sup> After the priest has had the woman stand
before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands
the reminder offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he
himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3812">19</sup> Then the priest shall put
the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has slept
with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while
married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse
not harm you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3813">20</sup>
But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you
have defiled yourself by sleeping with a man other than your
husband”— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3814">21</sup> here
the priest is to put the woman under this curse of the oath—“may
the LORD cause your people to curse and denounce you when he causes
your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3814d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3815">22</sup> May this water that brings a curse enter
your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes
away.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3815e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be
it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3816">23</sup> “‘The
priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off
into the bitter water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3817">24</sup> He shall have the woman drink the bitter
water that brings a curse, and this water will enter her and cause
bitter suffering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3818">25</sup> The priest is to take from her hands the
grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it
to the altar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3819">26</sup>
The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a
memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to
have the woman drink the water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3820">27</sup> If she has defiled herself and been
unfaithful to her husband, then when she is made to drink the water
that brings a curse, it will go into her and cause bitter
suffering; her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste
away,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3820f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> and she will become accursed among
her people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3821">28</sup> If,
however, the woman has not defiled herself and is free from
impurity, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have
children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3822">29</sup>
“‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and
defiles herself while married to her husband, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3823">30</sup> or when feelings of jealousy come
over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her
stand before the LORD and is to apply this entire law to her.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3824">31</sup> The husband
will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the
consequences of her sin.’”</p>
