<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Covenant With Abram</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-362">1</sup> After this,
the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not be afraid, Abram.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am your shield,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-362a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your very great reward.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-362b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-363">2</sup> But
Abram said, “O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain
childless and the one who will inherit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-363c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-364">3</sup> And Abram said,
“You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will
be my heir.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-365">4</sup> Then the
word of the LORD came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but
a son coming from your own body will be your heir.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-366">5</sup> He took him outside and
said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can
count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-367">6</sup> Abram
believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-368">7</sup> He also
said to him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the
Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-369">8</sup> But
Abram said, “O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain
possession of it?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-370">9</sup> So the
LORD said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three
years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-371">10</sup> Abram
brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves
opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-372">11</sup> Then birds of
prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-373">12</sup> As the
sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and
dreadful darkness came over him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-374">13</sup> Then the LORD said to him, “Know for
certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not
their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred
years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-375">14</sup> But I
will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they
will come out with great possessions. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-376">15</sup> You, however, will go to your fathers in
peace and be buried at a good old age. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-377">16</sup> In the fourth generation your descendants
will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet
reached its full measure.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-378">17</sup> When
the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a
blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-379">18</sup> On that day the LORD made a
covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this
land, from the river<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-379d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of Egypt
to the great river, the Euphrates— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-380">19</sup> the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites,
Kadmonites, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-381">20</sup>
Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-382">21</sup> Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and
Jebusites.”</p>
