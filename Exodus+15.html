<h4>Exodus 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Song of Moses and Miriam</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1922">1</sup> Then Moses
and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will sing to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is highly exalted.<br>
The horse and its rider<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has hurled into the sea.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1923">2</sup> The LORD is my
strength and my song;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has become my salvation.<br>
He is my God, and I will praise him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father’s God, and I will exalt him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1924">3</sup> The LORD is a
warrior;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD is his name.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1925">4</sup> Pharaoh’s
chariots and his army<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has hurled into the sea.<br>
The best of Pharaoh’s officers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are drowned in the Red Sea.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1925a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1926">5</sup> The deep waters
have covered them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they sank to the depths like a stone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1927">6</sup> “Your
right hand, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was majestic in power.<br>
Your right hand, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shattered the enemy.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1928">7</sup> In the greatness
of your majesty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you threw down those who opposed you.<br>
You unleashed your burning anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it consumed them like stubble.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1929">8</sup> By the blast of
your nostrils<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the waters piled up.<br>
The surging waters stood firm like a wall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deep waters congealed in the heart of the
sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1930">9</sup> “The
enemy boasted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will pursue, I will overtake them.<br>
I will divide the spoils;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will gorge myself on them.<br>
I will draw my sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hand will destroy them.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1931">10</sup> But you blew
with your breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sea covered them.<br>
They sank like lead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mighty waters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1932">11</sup> “Who
among the gods is like you, O LORD?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is like you—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majestic in holiness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome in glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working wonders?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1933">12</sup> You stretched
out your right hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the earth swallowed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1934">13</sup> “In
your unfailing love you will lead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people you have redeemed.<br>
In your strength you will guide them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your holy dwelling.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1935">14</sup> The nations
will hear and tremble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anguish will grip the people of Philistia.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1936">15</sup> The chiefs of
Edom will be terrified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the leaders of Moab will be seized with
trembling,<br>
the people<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1936b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of Canaan will melt
away;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1937">16</sup> terror
and dread will fall upon them.<br>
By the power of your arm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be as still as a stone—<br>
until your people pass by, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the people you bought<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1937c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> pass by.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1938">17</sup> You will bring
them in and plant them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the mountain of your inheritance—<br>
the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands
established.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1939">18</sup> The LORD will
reign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1940">19</sup> When
Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1940d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> went into the sea, the LORD
brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites
walked through the sea on dry ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1941">20</sup> Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s
sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed
her, with tambourines and dancing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1942">21</sup> Miriam sang to them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sing to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is highly exalted.<br>
The horse and its rider<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has hurled into the sea.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Waters of Marah and Elim</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1943">22</sup> Then
Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of
Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding
water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1944">23</sup> When
they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was
bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1944e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1945">24</sup> So the people grumbled against Moses,
saying, “What are we to drink?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1946">25</sup> Then
Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of
wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the LORD made a decree and a law for
them, and there he tested them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1947">26</sup> He said, “If you listen carefully to the
voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you
pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not
bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I
am the LORD, who heals you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1948">27</sup> Then
they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm
trees, and they camped there near the water.</p>
