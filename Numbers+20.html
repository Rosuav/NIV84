<h4>Numbers 20</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Water From the Rock</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4313">1</sup> In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4314">2</sup> Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4315">3</sup> They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the LORD! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4316">4</sup> Why did you bring the LORD’s community into this desert, that we and our livestock should die here? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4317">5</sup> Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4318">6</sup> Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4319">7</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4320">8</sup> “Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4321">9</sup> So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence, just as he commanded him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4322">10</sup> He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4323">11</sup> Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4324">12</sup> But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4325">13</sup> These were the waters of Meribah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4325a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD and where he showed himself holy among them. <h5 class="passage-header">Edom Denies Israel Passage</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4326">14</sup> Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come upon us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4327">15</sup> Our forefathers went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4328">16</sup> but when we cried out to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4329">17</sup> Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king’s highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4330">18</sup> But Edom answered: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4331">19</sup> The Israelites replied: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4332">20</sup> Again they answered: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may not pass through.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4333">21</sup> Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them. <h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Aaron</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4334">22</sup> The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4335">23</sup> At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4336">24</sup> “Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4337">25</sup> Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4338">26</sup> Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4339">27</sup> Moses did as the LORD commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4340">28</sup> Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4341">29</sup> and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-4325a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-4325" title="Ir a Numbers 20:13">Numbers 20:13</a> <i>Meribah</i> means <i>quarreling</i>.</li>
