<h4>Acts 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Stephen’s Speech to the Sanhedrin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27107">1</sup> Then the
high priest asked him, “Are these charges true?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27108">2</sup> To
this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of
glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in
Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27109">3</sup> ‘Leave your country and your people,’
God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27109a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27110">4</sup> “So he
left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the
death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now
living. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27111">5</sup> He gave
him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God
promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess
the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27112">6</sup> God spoke to
him in this way: ‘Your descendants will be strangers in a country
not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four
hundred years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27113">7</sup>
But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and
afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this
place.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27113b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27114">8</sup> Then he gave Abraham the covenant of
circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and
circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the
father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve
patriarchs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27115">9</sup>
“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a
slave into Egypt. But God was with him <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27116">10</sup> and rescued him from all his troubles.
He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of
Pharaoh king of Egypt; so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his
palace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27117">11</sup> “Then
a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and
our fathers could not find food. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27118">12</sup> When Jacob heard that there was grain
in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27119">13</sup> On their second visit,
Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about
Joseph’s family. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27120">14</sup> After this, Joseph sent for his father
Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27121">15</sup> Then Jacob went down to
Egypt, where he and our fathers died. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27122">16</sup> Their bodies were brought back to
Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the
sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27123">17</sup> “As
the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the
number of our people in Egypt greatly increased. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27124">18</sup> Then another king, who
knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27125">19</sup> He dealt treacherously
with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to
throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27126">20</sup> “At
that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27126c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> For three months he was cared for in
his father’s house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27127">21</sup> When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s
daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27128">22</sup> Moses was educated in all
the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and
action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27129">23</sup> “When
Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow
Israelites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27130">24</sup> He
saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his
defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27131">25</sup> Moses thought that his
own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but
they did not. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27132">26</sup>
The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He
tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do
you want to hurt each other?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27133">27</sup> “But
the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said,
‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27134">28</sup> Do you want to kill me as you killed
the Egyptian yesterday?’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27134d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27135">29</sup> When Moses
heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and
had two sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27136">30</sup>
“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the
flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27137">31</sup> When he saw
this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more
closely, he heard the Lord’s voice: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27138">32</sup> ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27138e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> Moses
trembled with fear and did not dare to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27139">33</sup> “Then
the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals; the place where you
are standing is holy ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27140">34</sup> I have indeed seen the oppression of my
people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to
set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27140f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27141">35</sup> “This
is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made
you ruler and judge?’ He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer
by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27142">36</sup> He led them
out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the
Red Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27142g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> and for forty years in the
desert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27143">37</sup> “This
is that Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will send you a prophet
like me from your own people.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27143h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27144">38</sup> He was in the
assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount
Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass
on to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27145">39</sup> “But
our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in
their hearts turned back to Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27146">40</sup> They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will
go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt—we
don’t know what has happened to him!’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27146i" title=
"See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27147">41</sup> That was the time they made an idol in
the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a
celebration in honor of what their hands had made. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27148">42</sup> But God turned away and
gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees
with what is written in the book of the prophets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Did you bring me sacrifices and
offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27149">43</sup> You have
lifted up the shrine of Molech<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the star of your god Rephan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idols you made to worship.<br>
Therefore I will send you into exile’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27149j" title=
"See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> beyond Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27150">44</sup> “Our
forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the
desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the
pattern he had seen. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27151">45</sup> Having received the tabernacle, our
fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land
from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land
until the time of David, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27152">46</sup> who enjoyed God’s favor and asked that
he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27152k" title=
"See footnote k">k</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27153">47</sup> But it was Solomon who built the house
for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27154">48</sup>
“However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the
prophet says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27155">49</sup>
“‘Heaven is my throne,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the earth is my footstool.<br>
What kind of house will you build for me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says
the Lord.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where will my resting place be?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27156">50</sup> Has not my
hand made all these things?’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27156l" title="See footnote l">l</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27157">51</sup> “You
stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are
just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27158">52</sup> Was there ever
a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those
who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have
betrayed and murdered him— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27159">53</sup> you who have received the law that was
put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Stoning of Stephen</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27160">54</sup> When
they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27161">55</sup> But Stephen,
full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of
God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27162">56</sup> “Look,” he said, “I see
heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27163">57</sup> At
this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their
voices, they all rushed at him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27164">58</sup> dragged him out of the city and began
to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the
feet of a young man named Saul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27165">59</sup> While
they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27166">60</sup> Then
he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin
against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.</p>
