<h4>Numbers 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Supplementary Offerings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4155">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4156">2</sup>
“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land
I am giving you as a home <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4157">3</sup> and you present to the LORD offerings
made by fire, from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to
the LORD—whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or
freewill offerings or festival offerings— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4158">4</sup> then the one who brings his offering
shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an
ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4158a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with a quarter
of a hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4158b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of oil. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4159">5</sup> With each lamb for the burnt offering or
the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink
offering.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4160">6</sup> “‘With
a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4160c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with a third
of a hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4160d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of oil, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4161">7</sup> and a third of a hin of wine as a drink
offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4162">8</sup> “‘When
you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a
special vow or a fellowship offering<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-4162e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> to the
LORD, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4163">9</sup> bring with
the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4163f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with half a
hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4163g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of oil. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4164">10</sup> Also bring half a hin of wine as a drink
offering. It will be an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4165">11</sup> Each
bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this
manner. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4166">12</sup> Do this
for each one, for as many as you prepare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4167">13</sup>
“‘Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when
he brings an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4168">14</sup> For the
generations to come, whenever an alien or anyone else living among
you presents an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the
LORD, he must do exactly as you do. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4169">15</sup> The community is to have the same rules
for you and for the alien living among you; this is a lasting
ordinance for the generations to come. You and the alien shall be
the same before the LORD: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4170">16</sup> The same laws and regulations will apply
both to you and to the alien living among you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4171">17</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4172">18</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: ‘When you enter the land to which I am taking you <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4173">19</sup> and you eat the food of
the land, present a portion as an offering to the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4174">20</sup> Present a cake from the
first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the
threshing floor. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4175">21</sup> Throughout the generations to come you
are to give this offering to the LORD from the first of your ground
meal.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Offerings for Unintentional Sins</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4176">22</sup> “‘Now if
you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the LORD
gave Moses— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4177">23</sup> any
of the LORD’s commands to you through him, from the day the LORD
gave them and continuing through the generations to come—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4178">24</sup> and if this is
done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then
the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering
as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed grain
offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4179">25</sup> The priest is
to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will
be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have brought to
the LORD for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin
offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4180">26</sup> The
whole Israelite community and the aliens living among them will be
forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional
wrong.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4181">27</sup> “‘But
if just one person sins unintentionally, he must bring a year-old
female goat for a sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4182">28</sup> The priest is to make atonement before
the LORD for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when
atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4183">29</sup> One and the same law
applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether he is a
native-born Israelite or an alien.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4184">30</sup> “‘But
anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or alien, blasphemes
the LORD, and that person must be cut off from his people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4185">31</sup> Because he has
despised the LORD’s word and broken his commands, that person must
surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Sabbath-Breaker Put to Death</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4186">32</sup> While the
Israelites were in the desert, a man was found gathering wood on
the Sabbath day. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4187">33</sup> Those who found him gathering wood
brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4188">34</sup> and they kept him in
custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4189">35</sup> Then the LORD
said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him
outside the camp.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4190">36</sup> So the assembly took him outside the
camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<h5 class="passage-header">Tassels on Garments</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4191">37</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4192">38</sup>
“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Throughout the
generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your
garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4193">39</sup> You will have these tassels to look
at and so you will remember all the commands of the LORD, that you
may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the
lusts of your own hearts and eyes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4194">40</sup> Then you will remember to obey all my
commands and will be consecrated to your God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4195">41</sup> I am the LORD your God, who brought
you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.’”
