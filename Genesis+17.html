<h4>Genesis 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Covenant of Circumcision</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-399">1</sup> When Abram
was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am
God Almighty<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-399a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>; walk before me and be
blameless. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-400">2</sup> I will
confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase
your numbers.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-401">3</sup> Abram
fell facedown, and God said to him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-402">4</sup> “As for me, this is my covenant with you:
You will be the father of many nations. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-403">5</sup> No longer will you be called
Abram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-403b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; your name will be
Abraham,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-403c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> for I have made you a father of
many nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-404">6</sup> I
will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings
will come from you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-405">7</sup> I will establish my covenant as an
everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after
you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your
descendants after you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-406">8</sup> The whole land of Canaan, where you are
now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and
your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-407">9</sup> Then God
said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and
your descendants after you for the generations to come. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-408">10</sup> This is my covenant with
you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep:
Every male among you shall be circumcised. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-409">11</sup> You are to undergo circumcision, and
it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-410">12</sup> For the generations to come
every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised,
including those born in your household or bought with money from a
foreigner—those who are not your offspring. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-411">13</sup> Whether born in your household or
bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in
your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-412">14</sup> Any uncircumcised male, who has not
been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he
has broken my covenant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-413">15</sup> God
also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to
call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-414">16</sup> I will bless her and will surely give you
a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of
nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-415">17</sup> Abraham
fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born
to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of
ninety?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-416">18</sup> And
Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your
blessing!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-417">19</sup> Then
God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you
will call him Isaac.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-417d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> I will
establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his
descendants after him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-418">20</sup> And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I
will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly
increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I
will make him into a great nation. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-419">21</sup> But my covenant I will establish with
Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-420">22</sup> When he had
finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-421">23</sup> On that
very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his
household or bought with his money, every male in his household,
and circumcised them, as God told him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-422">24</sup> Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he
was circumcised, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-423">25</sup>
and his son Ishmael was thirteen; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-424">26</sup> Abraham and his son Ishmael were both
circumcised on that same day. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-425">27</sup> And every male in Abraham’s household,
including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner,
was circumcised with him.</p>
