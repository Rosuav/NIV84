<p><h4>Romans 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">God’s Sovereign Choice</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28142">1</sup> I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28143">2</sup> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28144">3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28145">4</sup> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28146">5</sup> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised!<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28146a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Amen. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28147">6</sup> It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28148">7</sup> Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28148b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28149">8</sup> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28150">9</sup> For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28150c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28151">10</sup> Not only that, but Rebekah’s children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28152">11</sup> Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28153">12</sup> not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28153d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28154">13</sup> Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28154e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28155">14</sup> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28156">15</sup> For he says to Moses, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28156f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28157">16</sup> It does not, therefore, depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28158">17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28158g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28159">18</sup> Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28160">19</sup> One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28161">20</sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28161h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28162">21</sup> Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28163">22</sup> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28164">23</sup> What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28165">24</sup> even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28166">25</sup> As he says in Hosea: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28166i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28167">26</sup> and, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You are not my people,’ <br />they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28167j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28168">27</sup> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only the remnant will be saved. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28169">28</sup> For the Lord will carry out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28169k" title="See footnote k">k</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28170">29</sup> It is just as Isaiah said previously: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Unless the Lord Almighty <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had left us descendants, <br />we would have become like Sodom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would have been like Gomorrah.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28170l" title="See footnote l">l</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">Israel’s Unbelief</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28171">30</sup> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28172">31</sup> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28173">32</sup> Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the “stumbling stone.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28174">33</sup> As it is written: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a rock that makes them fall, <br />and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28174m" title="See footnote m">m</a>]</sup> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28146a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28146" title="Go to Romans 9:5">Romans 9:5</a> Or <i>Christ, who is over all.
