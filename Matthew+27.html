<p><h4>Matthew 27</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Judas Hangs Himself</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24128">1</sup> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24129">2</sup> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24130">3</sup> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24131">4</sup> “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24132">5</sup> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24133">6</sup> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24134">7</sup> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24135">8</sup> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24136">9</sup> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24137">10</sup> and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24137a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Before Pilate</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24138">11</sup> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Yes, it is as you say,”</font> Jesus replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24139">12</sup> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24140">13</sup> Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24141">14</sup> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24142">15</sup> Now it was the governor’s custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24143">16</sup> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24144">17</sup> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24145">18</sup> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24146">19</sup> While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24147">20</sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24148">21</sup> “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Barabbas,” they answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24149">22</sup> “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all answered, “Crucify him!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24150">23</sup> “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24151">24</sup> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24152">25</sup> All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24153">26</sup> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <h5 class="passage-header">The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24154">27</sup> Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24155">28</sup> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24156">29</sup> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24157">30</sup> They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24158">31</sup> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Crucifixion</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24159">32</sup> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24160">33</sup> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24161">34</sup> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24162">35</sup> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24162b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24163">36</sup> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24164">37</sup> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24165">38</sup> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24166">39</sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24167">40</sup> and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24168">41</sup> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24169">42</sup> “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24170">43</sup> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24171">44</sup> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24172">45</sup> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24173">46</sup> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <font class='woj'><i>“Eloi, Eloi,</i><sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24173c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <i>lama</i> <i>sabachthani?”</i></font>—which means, <font class='woj'>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24173d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24174">47</sup> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24175">48</sup> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24176">49</sup> The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24177">50</sup> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24178">51</sup> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24179">52</sup> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24180">53</sup> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus’ resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24181">54</sup> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24181e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> of God!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24182">55</sup> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24183">56</sup> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. <h5 class="passage-header">The Burial of Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24184">57</sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24185">58</sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24186">59</sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24187">60</sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24188">61</sup> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. <h5 class="passage-header">The Guard at the Tomb</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24189">62</sup> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24190">63</sup> “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24191">64</sup> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24192">65</sup> “Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24193">66</sup> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24137a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24137" title="Go to Matthew 27:10">Matthew 27:10</a> See Zech. 11:12,13; Jer. 19:1-13; 32:6-9.</li>
