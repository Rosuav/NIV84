<h4>1 Kings 6</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Solomon Builds the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8898">1</sup> In the four hundred and eightieth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8898a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8899">2</sup> The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8899b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8900">3</sup> The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8900c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and projected ten cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8900d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> from the front of the temple. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8901">4</sup> He made narrow clerestory windows in the temple. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8902">5</sup> Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8903">6</sup> The lowest floor was five cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8903e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> wide, the middle floor six cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8903f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> and the third floor seven.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8903g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8904">7</sup> In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8905">8</sup> The entrance to the lowest<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8905h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8906">9</sup> So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8907">10</sup> And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8908">11</sup> The word of the LORD came to Solomon: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8909">12</sup> “As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8910">13</sup> And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8911">14</sup> So Solomon built the temple and completed it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8912">15</sup> He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of pine. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8913">16</sup> He partitioned off twenty cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8913i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8914">17</sup> The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8914j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> long. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8915">18</sup> The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8916">19</sup> He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8917">20</sup> The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8917k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8918">21</sup> Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8919">22</sup> So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8920">23</sup> In the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8920l" title="Vea nota al pie l">l</a>]</sup> high. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8921">24</sup> One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8922">25</sup> The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8923">26</sup> The height of each cherub was ten cubits. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8924">27</sup> He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8925">28</sup> He overlaid the cherubim with gold. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8926">29</sup> On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8927">30</sup> He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8928">31</sup> For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood with five-sided jambs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8929">32</sup> And on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with beaten gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8930">33</sup> In the same way he made four-sided jambs of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8931">34</sup> He also made two pine doors, each having two leaves that turned in sockets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8932">35</sup> He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8933">36</sup> And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8934">37</sup> The foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8935">38</sup> In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8898a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8898" title="Ir a 1 Kings 6:1">1 Kings 6:1</a> Hebrew; Septuagint <i>four hundred and fortieth</i></li>
