<h4>2 Corinthians 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Paul and the False Apostles</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28975">1</sup> I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28976">2</sup> I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28977">3</sup> But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28978">4</sup> For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28979">5</sup> But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28980">6</sup> I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28981">7</sup> Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28982">8</sup> I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28983">9</sup> And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28984">10</sup> As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28985">11</sup> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28986">12</sup> And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28987">13</sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28988">14</sup> And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28989">15</sup> It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. <h5 class="passage-header">Paul Boasts About His Sufferings</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28990">16</sup> I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28991">17</sup> In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28992">18</sup> Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28993">19</sup> You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28994">20</sup> In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28995">21</sup> To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28996">22</sup> Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28997">23</sup> Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28998">24</sup> Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28999">25</sup> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29000">26</sup> I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29001">27</sup> I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29002">28</sup> Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29003">29</sup> Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29004">30</sup> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29005">31</sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29006">32</sup> In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29007">33</sup> But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands. </div></body></html>
