<h4>Mark 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Before Pilate</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24821">1</sup> Very
early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the
teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision.
They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24822">2</sup> “Are
you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Yes, it is as you
say,”</font> Jesus replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24823">3</sup> The
chief priests accused him of many things. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24824">4</sup> So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you
going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24825">5</sup> But
Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24826">6</sup> Now it
was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people
requested. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24827">7</sup> A
man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had
committed murder in the uprising. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24828">8</sup> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do
for them what he usually did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24829">9</sup> “Do
you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24830">10</sup> knowing it was
out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24831">11</sup> But the chief
priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas
instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24832">12</sup> “What
shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?”
Pilate asked them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24833">13</sup>
“Crucify him!” they shouted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24834">14</sup> “Why?
What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify
him!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24835">15</sup>
Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He
had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24836">16</sup> The
soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium)
and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24837">17</sup> They put a purple robe on
him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24838">18</sup> And they began
to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24839">19</sup> Again and again they struck him on
the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they
paid homage to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24840">20</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took
off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led
him out to crucify him.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Crucifixion</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24841">21</sup> A
certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus,
was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him
to carry the cross. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24842">22</sup> They brought Jesus to the place called
Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24843">23</sup> Then they offered him
wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24844">24</sup> And they crucified him.
Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24845">25</sup> It
was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24846">26</sup> The written notice of the charge
against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24847">27</sup> They crucified two robbers with him,
one on his right and one on his left.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24847a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24848">29</sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at
him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to
destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24849">30</sup> come down from the cross
and save yourself!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24850">31</sup> In
the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked
him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t
save himself! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24851">32</sup>
Let this Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24851b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> this King
of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and
believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24852">33</sup> At the
sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24853">34</sup> And at the
ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <font class=
'woj'><i>“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”</i></font>—which means,
<font class='woj'>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24853c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24854">35</sup> When
some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he’s
calling Elijah.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24855">36</sup> One
man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and
offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if
Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24856">37</sup> With
a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24857">38</sup> The
curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24858">39</sup> And when the
centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry
and<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24858d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> saw how he died, he said, “Surely
this man was the Son<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24858e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> of
God!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24859">40</sup> Some
women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and
Salome. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24860">41</sup> In
Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many
other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also
there.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Burial of Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24861">42</sup> It was
Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as
evening approached, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24862">43</sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member
of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God,
went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24863">44</sup> Pilate was surprised to
hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked
him if Jesus had already died. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24864">45</sup> When he learned from the centurion that
it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24865">46</sup> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took
down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut
out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the
tomb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24866">47</sup> Mary
Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
