<h4>2 Chronicles 21</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11626">1</sup> Then
Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the
City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11627">2</sup> Jehoram’s
brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah,
Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of
Jehoshaphat king of Israel.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11627a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11628">3</sup> Their father
had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value,
as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom
to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoram King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11629">4</sup> When
Jehoram established himself firmly over his father’s kingdom, he
put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11630">5</sup> Jehoram
was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem eight years. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11631">6</sup> He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of
Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11632">7</sup> Nevertheless, because of the covenant
the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy
the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and
his descendants forever.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11633">8</sup> In the
time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own
king. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11634">9</sup> So
Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The
Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up
and broke through by night. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11635">10</sup> To this day Edom has been in rebellion
against Judah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libnah revolted at the same time, because
Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11636">11</sup> He had also built high
places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem
to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11637">12</sup>
Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is what the LORD, the God of your father
David, says: ‘You have not walked in the ways of your father
Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11638">13</sup> But you have walked in the ways of the
kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem
to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have
also murdered your own brothers, members of your father’s house,
men who were better than you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11639">14</sup> So now the LORD is about to strike your
people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a
heavy blow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11640">15</sup>
You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the
bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11641">16</sup> The
LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and
of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11642">17</sup> They attacked Judah, invaded it and
carried off all the goods found in the king’s palace, together with
his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except
Ahaziah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11642b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> the youngest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11643">18</sup> After
all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of
the bowels. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11644">19</sup> In
the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came
out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people
made no fire in his honor, as they had for his fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11645">20</sup>
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one’s
regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs
of the kings.</p>
