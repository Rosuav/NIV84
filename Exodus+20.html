<h4>Exodus 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Ten Commandments</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2053">1</sup> And God
spoke all these words:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2054">2</sup> “I am
the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2055">3</sup> “You
shall have no other gods before<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2055a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2056">4</sup> “You
shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in
heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2057">5</sup> You shall not
bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a
jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to
the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2058">6</sup> but showing love to a
thousand generations of those who love me and keep my
commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2059">7</sup> “You
shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will
not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2060">8</sup>
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2061">9</sup> Six days you shall labor and do all
your work, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2062">10</sup> but
the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall
not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your
manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within
your gates. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2063">11</sup> For
in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and
all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore
the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2064">12</sup> “Honor
your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land
the LORD your God is giving you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2065">13</sup> “You
shall not murder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2066">14</sup> “You
shall not commit adultery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2067">15</sup> “You
shall not steal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2068">16</sup> “You
shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2069">17</sup> “You
shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your
neighbor’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or
donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2070">18</sup> When
the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and
saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at
a distance <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2071">19</sup> and
said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not
have God speak to us or we will die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2072">20</sup> Moses
said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so
that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from
sinning.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2073">21</sup> The
people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick
darkness where God was.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Idols and Altars</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2074">22</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for
yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2075">23</sup> Do not make any gods to be
alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of
gold.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2076">24</sup> “‘Make
an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings
and fellowship offerings,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2076b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> your
sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be
honored, I will come to you and bless you. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2077">25</sup> If you make an altar of stones for
me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if
you use a tool on it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2078">26</sup> And do not go up to my altar on steps,
lest your nakedness be exposed on it.’</p>
