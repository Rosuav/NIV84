So it was named Allon Bacuth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1020b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1021">9</sup> After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1021c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> God appeared to him again and blessed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1022">10</sup> God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1022d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1022e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>” So he named him Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1023">11</sup> And God said to him, “I am God Almighty<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1023f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup>; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1024">12</sup> The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1025">13</sup> Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1026">14</sup> Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1027">15</sup> Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1027g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1028">16</sup> Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1029">17</sup> And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have another son.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1030">18</sup> As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1030h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> But his father named him Benjamin.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1030i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1031">19</sup> So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1032">20</sup> Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1033">21</sup> Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1034">22</sup> While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob had twelve sons: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1035">23</sup> The sons of Leah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1036">24</sup> The sons of Rachel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph and Benjamin. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1037">25</sup> The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan and Naphtali. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1038">26</sup> The sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gad and Asher. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1039">27</sup> Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1040">28</sup> Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1041">29</sup> Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years.
