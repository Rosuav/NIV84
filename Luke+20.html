<p><h4>Luke 20</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25772">1</sup> One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25773">2</sup> “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25774">3</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25775">4</sup> John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25776">5</sup> They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25777">6</sup> But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25778">7</sup> So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25779">8</sup> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Tenants</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25780">9</sup> He went on to tell the people this parable: <font class='woj'>“A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25781">10</sup> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25782">11</sup> He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25783">12</sup> He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25784">13</sup> “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25785">14</sup> “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25786">15</sup> So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25787">16</sup> He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people heard this, they said, “May this never be!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25788">17</sup> Jesus looked directly at them and asked, <font class='woj'>“Then what is the meaning of that which is written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘The stone the builders rejected</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>has become the capstone<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25788a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25788b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25789">18</sup> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25790">19</sup> The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. <h5 class="passage-header">Paying Taxes to Caesar</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25791">20</sup> Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25792">21</sup> So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25793">22</sup> Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25794">23</sup> He saw through their duplicity and said to them, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25795">24</sup> “Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25796">25</sup> “Caesar’s,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to them, <font class='woj'>“Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25797">26</sup> They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. <h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection and Marriage</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25798">27</sup> Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25799">28</sup> “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25800">29</sup> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25801">30</sup> The second <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25802">31</sup> and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25803">32</sup> Finally, the woman died too. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25804">33</sup> Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25805">34</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25806">35</sup> But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25807">36</sup> and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25808">37</sup> But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25808c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25809">38</sup> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25810">39</sup> Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25811">40</sup> And no one dared to ask him any more questions. <h5 class="passage-header">Whose Son Is the Christ?</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25812">41</sup> Then Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“How is it that they say the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25812d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> is the Son of David?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25813">42</sup> David himself declares in the Book of Psalms:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘The Lord said to my Lord:</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Sit at my right hand</font> <br /><font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25814">43</sup> until I make your enemies</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>a footstool for your feet.”’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25814e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25815">44</sup> David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25816">45</sup> While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25817">46</sup> “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25818">47</sup> They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25788a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25788" title="Go to Luke 20:17">Luke 20:17</a> Or <i>cornerstone</i></li>
