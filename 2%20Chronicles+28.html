<h4>2 Chronicles 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ahaz King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11766">1</sup> Ahaz was
twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem
sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was
right in the eyes of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11767">2</sup> He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11768">3</sup> He burned
sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in
the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had
driven out before the Israelites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11769">4</sup> He offered sacrifices and burned incense
at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11770">5</sup>
Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The
Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and
brought them to Damascus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also given into the hands of the king
of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11771">6</sup> In one day Pekah son of
Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in
Judah—because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their
fathers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11772">7</sup> Zicri,
an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the
officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11773">8</sup> The Israelites
took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons
and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they
carried back to Samaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11774">9</sup> But a
prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet
the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, “Because the
LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them
into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that
reaches to heaven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11775">10</sup> And now you intend to make the men and
women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren’t you also
guilty of sins against the LORD your God? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11776">11</sup> Now listen to me! Send back your fellow
countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD’s fierce anger
rests on you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11777">12</sup> Then
some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah
son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of
Hadlai—confronted those who were arriving from the war. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11778">13</sup> “You must not bring those
prisoners here,” they said, “or we will be guilty before the LORD.
Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already
great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11779">14</sup> So
the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of
the officials and all the assembly. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11780">15</sup> The men designated by name took the
prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked.
They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and
healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they
took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of
Palms, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11781">16</sup> At
that time King Ahaz sent to the king<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11781a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of
Assyria for help. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11782">17</sup> The Edomites had again come and
attacked Judah and carried away prisoners, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11783">18</sup> while the Philistines had raided
towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and
occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soco,
Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11784">19</sup> The LORD had humbled
Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11784b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> for he had promoted wickedness in
Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11785">20</sup>
Tiglath-Pileser<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11785c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> king of Assyria came to him,
but he gave him trouble instead of help. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11786">21</sup> Ahaz took some of the things from the
temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the princes
and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11787">22</sup> In
his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11788">23</sup> He
offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him;
for he thought, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped
them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they were
his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11789">24</sup> Ahaz
gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took
them away.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11789d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> He shut the doors of the
LORD’s temple and set up altars at every street corner in
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11790">25</sup> In
every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to
other gods and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to
anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11791">26</sup> The
other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end,
are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11792">27</sup> Ahaz rested
with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he
was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah
his son succeeded him as king.</p>
