<h4>Isaiah 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Isaiah’s Commission</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17771">1</sup> In the
year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high
and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17772">2</sup> Above him were
seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their
faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were
flying. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17773">3</sup> And
they were calling to one another:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole earth is full of his glory.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17774">4</sup> At the
sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the
temple was filled with smoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17775">5</sup> “Woe
to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and
I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the
King, the LORD Almighty.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17776">6</sup> Then
one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which
he had taken with tongs from the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17777">7</sup> With it he touched my mouth and said,
“See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your
sin atoned for.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17778">8</sup> Then I
heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who
will go for us?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17779">9</sup> He
said, “Go and tell this people:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Be ever hearing, but never
understanding;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17780">10</sup> Make the heart
of this people calloused;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make their ears dull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and close their eyes.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17780a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear with their ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand with their hearts,<br>
and turn and be healed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17781">11</sup> Then
I said, “For how long, O Lord?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Until the cities lie ruined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and without inhabitant,<br>
until the houses are left deserted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fields ruined and ravaged,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17782">12</sup> until the LORD
has sent everyone far away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the land is utterly forsaken.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17783">13</sup> And though a
tenth remains in the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will again be laid waste.<br>
But as the terebinth and oak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave stumps when they are cut down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the holy seed will be the stump in the
land.”</p>
