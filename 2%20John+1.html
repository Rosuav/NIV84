<h4>2 John 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30631">1</sup> The
elder,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the chosen lady and her children, whom I
love in the truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30632">2</sup> because of the
truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30633">3</sup> Grace,
mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the
Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30634">4</sup> It has
given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the
truth, just as the Father commanded us. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30635">5</sup> And now, dear lady, I am not writing you
a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we
love one another. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30636">6</sup> And this is love: that we walk in
obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning,
his command is that you walk in love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30637">7</sup> Many
deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the
flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the
deceiver and the antichrist. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30638">8</sup> Watch out that you do not lose what you
have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30639">9</sup> Anyone who runs ahead and
does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God;
whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30640">10</sup> If anyone
comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into
your house or welcome him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30641">11</sup> Anyone who welcomes him shares in his
wicked work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30642">12</sup> I
have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink.
Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so
that our joy may be complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30643">13</sup> The
children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</p>
