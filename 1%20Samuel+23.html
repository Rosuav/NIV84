<h4>1 Samuel 23</h4><h5 class="passage-header">David Saves Keilah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7812">1</sup> When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7813">2</sup> he inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7814">3</sup> But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7815">4</sup> Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7816">5</sup> So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7817">6</sup> (Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.) <h5 class="passage-header">Saul Pursues David</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7818">7</sup> Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7819">8</sup> And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7820">9</sup> When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7821">10</sup> David said, “O LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7822">11</sup> Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the LORD said, “He will.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7823">12</sup> Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the LORD said, “They will.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7824">13</sup> So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7825">14</sup> David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7826">15</sup> While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7827">16</sup> And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7828">17</sup> “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7829">18</sup> The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7830">19</sup> The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7831">20</sup> Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7832">21</sup> Saul replied, “The LORD bless you for your concern for me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7833">22</sup> Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7834">23</sup> Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7834a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7835">24</sup> So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7836">25</sup> Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7837">26</sup> Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7838">27</sup> a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7839">28</sup> Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7839b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7840">29</sup> And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-7834a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-7834" title="Ir a 1 Samuel 23:23">1 Samuel 23:23</a> Or <i>me at Nacon</i></li>
