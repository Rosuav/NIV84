It will be 25,000 cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21711b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> wide, and its length from east to west will equal one of the tribal portions; the sanctuary will be in the center of it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21712">9</sup> “The special portion you are to offer to the LORD will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21712c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> wide. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21713">10</sup> This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21714">11</sup> This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21715">12</sup> It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21716">13</sup> “Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21717">14</sup> They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21718">15</sup> “The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21719">16</sup> and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21720">17</sup> The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21721">18</sup> What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21722">19</sup> The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21723">20</sup> The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21724">21</sup> “What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the city property will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21725">22</sup> So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21726">23</sup> “As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21727">24</sup> “Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21728">25</sup> “Issachar will have one portion; it will border the territory of Simeon from east to west. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21729">26</sup> “Zebulun will have one portion; it will border the territory of Issachar from east to west. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21730">27</sup> “Gad will have one portion; it will border the territory of Zebulun from east to west. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21731">28</sup> “The southern boundary of Gad will run south from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21731d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21732">29</sup> “This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Sovereign LORD. <h5 class="passage-header">The Gates of the City</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21733">30</sup> “These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21734">31</sup> the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel.
