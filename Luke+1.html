<h4>Luke 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Introduction</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24887">1</sup> Many have
undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been
fulfilled<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24887a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> among us, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24888">2</sup> just as they were handed down to us
by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the
word. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24889">3</sup>
Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything
from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly
account for you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24890">4</sup> so that you may know the certainty of
the things you have been taught.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of John the Baptist
Foretold</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24891">5</sup> In the
time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who
belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was
also a descendant of Aaron. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24892">6</sup> Both of them were upright in the sight
of God, observing all the Lord’s commandments and regulations
blamelessly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24893">7</sup>
But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they
were both well along in years.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24894">8</sup> Once
when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest
before God, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24895">9</sup> he
was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go
into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24896">10</sup> And when the time for the burning of
incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying
outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24897">11</sup> Then
an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of
the altar of incense. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24898">12</sup> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled
and was gripped with fear. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24899">13</sup> But the angel said to him: “Do not be
afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth
will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24900">14</sup> He will be a
joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24901">15</sup> for he will be
great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other
fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even
from birth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24901b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24902">16</sup> Many of the people of Israel will he
bring back to the Lord their God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24903">17</sup> And he will go on before the Lord, in
the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers
to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24904">18</sup>
Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old
man and my wife is well along in years.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24905">19</sup> The
angel answered, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and
I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24906">20</sup> And now you
will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens,
because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their
proper time.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24907">21</sup>
Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why
he stayed so long in the temple. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24908">22</sup> When he came out, he could not speak to
them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept
making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24909">23</sup> When
his time of service was completed, he returned home. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24910">24</sup> After this his wife
Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in
seclusion. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24911">25</sup>
“The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has
shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24912">26</sup> In the
sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in
Galilee, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24913">27</sup> to a
virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of
David. The virgin’s name was Mary. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24914">28</sup> The angel went to her and said,
“Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24915">29</sup> Mary
was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of
greeting this might be. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24916">30</sup> But the angel said to her, “Do not be
afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24917">31</sup> You will be with child and give
birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24918">32</sup> He will be great and will
be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24919">33</sup> and he will reign over the house of
Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24920">34</sup> “How
will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24921">35</sup> The
angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power
of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born
will be called<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24921c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the Son of God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24922">36</sup> Even Elizabeth your
relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was
said to be barren is in her sixth month. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24923">37</sup> For nothing is impossible with
God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24924">38</sup> “I am
the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it be to me as you have
said.” Then the angel left her.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Mary Visits Elizabeth</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24925">39</sup> At that
time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of
Judea, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24926">40</sup> where
she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24927">41</sup> When Elizabeth heard
Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24928">42</sup> In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed
are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24929">43</sup> But why am I
so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24930">44</sup> As soon as the
sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped
for joy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24931">45</sup>
Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her
will be accomplished!”
<h5 class="passage-header">Mary’s Song</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24932">46</sup> And Mary
said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My soul glorifies the Lord<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24933">47</sup> and my
spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24934">48</sup> for he has
been mindful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the humble state of his servant.<br>
From now on all generations will call me blessed,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24935">49</sup> for the
Mighty One has done great things for me—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holy is his name.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24936">50</sup> His mercy
extends to those who fear him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from generation to generation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24937">51</sup> He has
performed mighty deeds with his arm;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has scattered those who are proud in their
inmost thoughts.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24938">52</sup> He has brought
down rulers from their thrones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but has lifted up the humble.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24939">53</sup> He has filled
the hungry with good things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but has sent the rich away empty.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24940">54</sup> He has helped
his servant Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembering to be merciful<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24941">55</sup> to Abraham and
his descendants forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even as he said to our fathers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24942">56</sup> Mary
stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned
home.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of John the Baptist</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24943">57</sup> When it
was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24944">58</sup> Her neighbors
and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and
they shared her joy.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24945">59</sup> On
the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were
going to name him after his father Zechariah, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24946">60</sup> but his mother spoke up and said,
“No! He is to be called John.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24947">61</sup> They
said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that
name.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24948">62</sup> Then
they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to
name the child. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24949">63</sup> He asked for a writing tablet, and to
everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24950">64</sup> Immediately his mouth was
opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising
God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24951">65</sup> The
neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country
of Judea people were talking about all these things. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24952">66</sup> Everyone who heard this
wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child going to be?”
For the Lord’s hand was with him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zechariah’s Song</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24953">67</sup> His
father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24954">68</sup>
“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he has come and has redeemed his
people.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24955">69</sup> He has raised
up a horn<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24955d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> of salvation for us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the house of his servant David<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24956">70</sup> (as he said
through his holy prophets of long ago),<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24957">71</sup> salvation from
our enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the hand of all who hate us—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24958">72</sup> to show mercy
to our fathers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to remember his holy covenant,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24959">73</sup> the oath
he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24960">74</sup> to rescue us
from the hand of our enemies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to enable us to serve him without fear<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24961">75</sup> in
holiness and righteousness before him all our days.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24962">76</sup> And you, my
child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the
way for him,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24963">77</sup> to give his
people the knowledge of salvation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the forgiveness of their sins,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24964">78</sup> because of the
tender mercy of our God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by which the rising sun will come to us from
heaven<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24965">79</sup> to shine on
those living in darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the shadow of death,<br>
to guide our feet into the path of peace.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24966">80</sup> And
the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the
desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.</p>
