<h4>Revelation 14</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Lamb and the 144,000</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30912">1</sup> Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30913">2</sup> And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30914">3</sup> And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30915">4</sup> These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30916">5</sup> No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. <h5 class="passage-header">The Three Angels</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30917">6</sup> Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30918">7</sup> He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30919">8</sup> A second angel followed and said, “Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30920">9</sup> A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30921">10</sup> he, too, will drink of the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30922">11</sup> And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30923">12</sup> This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God’s commandments and remain faithful to Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30924">13</sup> Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Harvest of the Earth</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30925">14</sup> I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one “like a son of man”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30925a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30926">15</sup> Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30927">16</sup> So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30928">17</sup> Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30929">18</sup> Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30930">19</sup> The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30931">20</sup> They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30931b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30925a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30925" title="Ir a Revelation 14:14">Revelation 14:14</a> Daniel 7:13</li>
