<h4>Isaiah 53</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18713">1</sup> Who
has believed our message<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to whom has the arm of the LORD been
revealed?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18714">2</sup> He grew up
before him like a tender shoot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a root out of dry ground.<br>
He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing in his appearance that we should desire
him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18715">3</sup> He was despised
and rejected by men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of sorrows, and familiar with
suffering.<br>
Like one from whom men hide their faces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18716">4</sup> Surely
he took up our infirmities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carried our sorrows,<br>
yet we considered him stricken by God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smitten by him, and afflicted.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18717">5</sup> But he was
pierced for our transgressions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was crushed for our iniquities;<br>
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by his wounds we are healed.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18718">6</sup> We all, like
sheep, have gone astray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each of us has turned to his own way;<br>
and the LORD has laid on him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity of us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18719">7</sup> He was
oppressed and afflicted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet he did not open his mouth;<br>
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he did not open his mouth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18720">8</sup> By
oppression<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18720a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and judgment he was taken
away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who can speak of his descendants?<br>
For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the transgression of my people he was
stricken.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18720b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18721">9</sup> He was assigned
a grave with the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the rich in his death,<br>
though he had done no violence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor was any deceit in his mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18722">10</sup> Yet
it was the LORDâ€™s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and though the LORD makes<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18722c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> his life a guilt offering,<br>
he will see his offspring and prolong his days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the will of the LORD will prosper in his
hand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18723">11</sup> After the
suffering of his soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will see the light of life<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18723d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and be satisfied<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18723e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>;<br>
by his knowledge<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18723f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> my
righteous servant will justify many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will bear their iniquities.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18724">12</sup> Therefore I
will give him a portion among the great,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18724g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will divide the spoils with the
strong,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18724h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup><br>
because he poured out his life unto death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was numbered with the transgressors.<br>
For he bore the sin of many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
