<h4>Isaiah 50</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel’s Sin and the Servant’s
Obedience</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18664">1</sup> This is
what the LORD says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where is your mother’s certificate of
divorce<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with which I sent her away?<br>
Or to which of my creditors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did I sell you?<br>
Because of your sins you were sold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of your transgressions your mother was
sent away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18665">2</sup> When I came,
why was there no one?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I called, why was there no one to
answer?<br>
Was my arm too short to ransom you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I lack the strength to rescue you?<br>
By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn rivers into a desert;<br>
their fish rot for lack of water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and die of thirst.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18666">3</sup> I clothe the
sky with darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make sackcloth its covering.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18667">4</sup> The
Sovereign LORD has given me an instructed tongue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know the word that sustains the weary.<br>
He wakens me morning by morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wakens my ear to listen like one being
taught.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18668">5</sup> The Sovereign
LORD has opened my ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I have not been rebellious;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not drawn back.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18669">6</sup> I offered my
back to those who beat me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard;<br>
I did not hide my face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from mocking and spitting.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18670">7</sup> Because the
Sovereign LORD helps me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be disgraced.<br>
Therefore have I set my face like flint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I know I will not be put to shame.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18671">8</sup> He who
vindicates me is near.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who then will bring charges against me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us face each other!<br>
Who is my accuser?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him confront me!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18672">9</sup> It is the
Sovereign LORD who helps me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is he that will condemn me?<br>
They will all wear out like a garment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the moths will eat them up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18673">10</sup> Who
among you fears the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and obeys the word of his servant?<br>
Let him who walks in the dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has no light,<br>
trust in the name of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rely on his God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18674">11</sup> But now, all
you who light fires<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provide yourselves with flaming torches,<br>
go, walk in the light of your fires<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of the torches you have set ablaze.<br>
This is what you shall receive from my hand:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will lie down in torment.</p>
