<p><h4>Matthew 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus and John the Baptist</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23461">1</sup> After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23461a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23462">2</sup> When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23463">3</sup> to ask him, “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23464">4</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“Go back and report to John what you hear and see:</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23465">5</sup> The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23465b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23466">6</sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23467">7</sup> As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: <font class='woj'>“What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23468">8</sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23469">9</sup> Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23470">10</sup> This is the one about whom it is written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>who will prepare your way before you.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23470c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23471">11</sup> I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23472">12</sup> From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23473">13</sup> For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23474">14</sup> And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23475">15</sup> He who has ears, let him hear.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23476">16</sup> “To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23477">17</sup> “‘We played the flute for you,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and you did not dance;</font> <br /><font class='woj'>we sang a dirge,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and you did not mourn.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23478">18</sup> For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23479">19</sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.”’ But wisdom is proved right by her actions.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Woe on Unrepentant Cities</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23480">20</sup> Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23481">21</sup> “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23482">22</sup> But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23483">23</sup> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies?
