<h4>Ephesians 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Made Alive in Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29215">1</sup> As for
you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29216">2</sup> in which you used to live
when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the
kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are
disobedient. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29217">3</sup>
All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the
cravings of our sinful nature<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29217a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and
following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by
nature objects of wrath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29218">4</sup> But because of his great love for us,
God, who is rich in mercy, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29219">5</sup> made us alive with Christ even when we
were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29220">6</sup> And God raised
us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in
Christ Jesus, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29221">7</sup>
in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable
riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29222">8</sup> For it
is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from
yourselves, it is the gift of God— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29223">9</sup> not by works, so that no one can boast.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29224">10</sup> For we are
God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which
God prepared in advance for us to do.
<h5 class="passage-header">One in Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29225">11</sup>
Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and
called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the
circumcision” (that done in the body by the hands of men)—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29226">12</sup> remember that
at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from
citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the
promise, without hope and without God in the world. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29227">13</sup> But now in Christ Jesus
you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood
of Christ.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29228">14</sup> For
he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed
the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29229">15</sup> by abolishing in his flesh the law
with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in
himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29230">16</sup> and in this one body to
reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to
death their hostility. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29231">17</sup> He came and preached peace to you who
were far away and peace to those who were near. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29232">18</sup> For through him we both
have access to the Father by one Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29233">19</sup>
Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow
citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29234">20</sup> built on the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself
as the chief cornerstone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29235">21</sup> In him the whole building is joined
together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29236">22</sup> And in him you too are
being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his
Spirit.</p>
