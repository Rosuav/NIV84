<p><h4>Hosea 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Israel to Reap the Whirlwind</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22196">1</sup> “Put the trumpet to your lips! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eagle is over the house of the LORD <br />because the people have broken my covenant <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rebelled against my law. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22197">2</sup> Israel cries out to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘O our God, we acknowledge you!’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22198">3</sup> But Israel has rejected what is good; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an enemy will pursue him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22199">4</sup> They set up kings without my consent; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they choose princes without my approval. <br />With their silver and gold <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make idols for themselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their own destruction. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22200">5</sup> Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anger burns against them. <br />How long will they be incapable of purity? <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22201">6</sup> They are from Israel! <br />This calf—a craftsman has made it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not God. <br />It will be broken in pieces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that calf of Samaria. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22202">7</sup> “They sow the wind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reap the whirlwind. <br />The stalk has no head; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will produce no flour. <br />Were it to yield grain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreigners would swallow it up. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22203">8</sup> Israel is swallowed up; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now she is among the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a worthless thing. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22204">9</sup> For they have gone up to Assyria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a wild donkey wandering alone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim has sold herself to lovers. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22205">10</sup> Although they have sold themselves among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now gather them together. <br />They will begin to waste away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the oppression of the mighty king. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22206">11</sup> “Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these have become altars for sinning. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22207">12</sup> I wrote for them the many things of my law, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they regarded them as something alien. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22208">13</sup> They offer sacrifices given to me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they eat the meat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD is not pleased with them. <br />Now he will remember their wickedness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and punish their sins: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will return to Egypt. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22209">14</sup> Israel has forgotten his Maker <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and built palaces; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah has fortified many towns. <br />But I will send fire upon their cities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will consume their fortresses.” </p></div></body></html>
