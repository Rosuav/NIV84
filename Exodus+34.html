<h4>Exodus 34</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The New Stone Tablets</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2498">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones,
and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets,
which you broke. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2499">2</sup>
Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present
yourself to me there on top of the mountain. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2500">3</sup> No one is to come with you or be seen
anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze
in front of the mountain.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2501">4</sup> So
Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went
up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him;
and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2502">5</sup> Then the LORD came down in
the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2503">6</sup> And he
passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The LORD, the LORD, the
compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love
and faithfulness, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2504">7</sup> maintaining love to thousands, and
forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the
guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for
the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2505">8</sup> Moses
bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2506">9</sup> “O Lord, if I have found favor in your
eyes,” he said, “then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a
stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take
us as your inheritance.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2507">10</sup> Then
the LORD said: “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your
people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the
world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work
that I, the LORD, will do for you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2508">11</sup> Obey what I command you today. I will
drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2509">12</sup> Be careful not to make a treaty with
those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a
snare among you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2510">13</sup> Break down their altars, smash their
sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2510a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2511">14</sup> Do not worship any other god, for the
LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2512">15</sup> “Be
careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for
when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to
them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2513">16</sup> And when you
choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those
daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your
sons to do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2514">17</sup> “Do
not make cast idols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2515">18</sup>
“Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread
made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed
time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of
Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2516">19</sup> “The
first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the
firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2517">20</sup> Redeem the
firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break
its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No one is to appear before me
empty-handed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2518">21</sup> “Six
days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even
during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2519">22</sup>
“Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat
harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the
year.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2519b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2520">23</sup> Three times a year all your men are to
appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2521">24</sup> I will drive out nations
before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your
land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD
your God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2522">25</sup> “Do
not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything
containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the
Passover Feast remain until morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2523">26</sup> “Bring
the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD
your God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s
milk.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2524">27</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance
with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2525">28</sup> Moses was there
with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or
drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the
covenant—the Ten Commandments.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Radiant Face of Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2526">29</sup> When
Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the
Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant
because he had spoken with the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2527">30</sup> When Aaron and all the Israelites saw
Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2528">31</sup> But Moses
called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came
back to him, and he spoke to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2529">32</sup> Afterward all the Israelites came near
him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on
Mount Sinai.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2530">33</sup> When
Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2531">34</sup> But whenever he
entered the LORD’s presence to speak with him, he removed the veil
until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites
what he had been commanded, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2532">35</sup> they saw that his face was radiant. Then
Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to
speak with the LORD.</p>
