<p><h4>Micah 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Man’s Plans and God’s</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22597">1</sup> Woe to those who plan iniquity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who plot evil on their beds! <br />At morning’s light they carry it out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it is in their power to do it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22598">2</sup> They covet fields and seize them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and houses, and take them. <br />They defraud a man of his home, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fellowman of his inheritance. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22599">3</sup> Therefore, the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am planning disaster against this people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from which you cannot save yourselves. <br />You will no longer walk proudly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it will be a time of calamity. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22600">4</sup> In that day men will ridicule you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will taunt you with this mournful song: <br />‘We are utterly ruined; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my people’s possession is divided up. <br />He takes it from me! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He assigns our fields to traitors.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22601">5</sup> Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to divide the land by lot. <h5 class="passage-header">False Prophets</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22602">6</sup> “Do not prophesy,” their prophets say. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not prophesy about these things; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disgrace will not overtake us.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22603">7</sup> Should it be said, O house of Jacob: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is the Spirit of the LORD angry? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he do such things?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not my words do good <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to him whose ways are upright? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22604">8</sup> Lately my people have risen up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like an enemy. <br />You strip off the rich robe <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from those who pass by without a care, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like men returning from battle. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22605">9</sup> You drive the women of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from their pleasant homes. <br />You take away my blessing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from their children forever. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22606">10</sup> Get up, go away! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this is not your resting place, <br />because it is defiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is ruined, beyond all remedy. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22607">11</sup> If a liar and deceiver comes and says, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he would be just the prophet for this people! <h5 class="passage-header">Deliverance Promised</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22608">12</sup> “I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. <br />I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a flock in its pasture; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the place will throng with people. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22609">13</sup> One who breaks open the way will go up before them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will break through the gate and go out. <br />Their king will pass through before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD at their head.” </p></div></body></html>
