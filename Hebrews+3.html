<h4>Hebrews 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Greater Than Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29981">1</sup>
Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix
your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we
confess. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29982">2</sup> He was
faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful
in all God’s house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29983">3</sup> Jesus has been found worthy of greater
honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor
than the house itself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29984">4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but
God is the builder of everything. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29985">5</sup> Moses was faithful as a servant in all
God’s house, testifying to what would be said in the future.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29986">6</sup> But Christ is
faithful as a son over God’s house. And we are his house, if we
hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning Against Unbelief</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29987">7</sup> So, as
the Holy Spirit says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today, if you hear his voice,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29988">8</sup> do not
harden your hearts<br>
as you did in the rebellion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the time of testing in the desert,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29989">9</sup> where your
fathers tested and tried me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for forty years saw what I did.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29990">10</sup> That is why I
was angry with that generation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going
astray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they have not known my ways.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29991">11</sup> So I declared
on oath in my anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29991a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29992">12</sup> See
to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart
that turns away from the living God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29993">13</sup> But encourage one another daily, as
long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by
sin’s deceitfulness. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29994">14</sup> We have come to share in Christ if we
hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29995">15</sup> As has just
been said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today, if you hear his voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts<br>
as you did in the rebellion.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29995b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29996">16</sup> Who
were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led
out of Egypt? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29997">17</sup>
And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those
who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29998">18</sup> And to whom did God swear that they
would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29998c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29999">19</sup> So we see that they were not able to
enter, because of their unbelief.</p>
