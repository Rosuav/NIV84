<h4>Genesis 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Hagar and Ishmael</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-383">1</sup> Now Sarai,
Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian
maidservant named Hagar; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-384">2</sup> so she said to Abram, “The LORD has kept
me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I
can build a family through her.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abram agreed to what Sarai said. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-385">3</sup> So after Abram had been
living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian
maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-386">4</sup> He slept with
Hagar, and she conceived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she knew she was pregnant, she began to
despise her mistress. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-387">5</sup> Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are
responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your
arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May
the LORD judge between you and me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-388">6</sup> “Your
servant is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you
think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-389">7</sup> The
angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was
the spring that is beside the road to Shur. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-390">8</sup> And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai,
where have you come from, and where are you going?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she
answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-391">9</sup> Then the
angel of the LORD told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to
her.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-392">10</sup> The angel
added, “I will so increase your descendants that they will be too
numerous to count.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-393">11</sup> The
angel of the LORD also said to her:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are now with child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will have a son.<br>
You shall name him Ishmael,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-393a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD has heard of your misery.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-394">12</sup> He will be a
wild donkey of a man;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand will be against everyone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and everyone’s hand against him,<br>
and he will live in hostility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-394b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> all his
brothers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-395">13</sup> She
gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: “You are the God who
sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-395c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> the One who sees me.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-396">14</sup> That is why the well was
called Beer Lahai Roi<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-396d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>; it is
still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-397">15</sup> So
Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son
she had borne. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-398">16</sup>
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</p>
