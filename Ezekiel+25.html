<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Ammon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21085">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21086">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against the
Ammonites and prophesy against them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21087">3</sup> Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the
Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you
said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the
land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah
when they went into exile, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21088">4</sup> therefore I am going to give you to the
people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps
and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink
your milk. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21089">5</sup> I
will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting
place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21090">6</sup> For this is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Because you have clapped your hands and
stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart
against the land of Israel, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21091">7</sup> therefore I will stretch out my hand
against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you
off from the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will
destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Moab</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21092">8</sup> “This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Look,
the house of Judah has become like all the other nations,”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21093">9</sup> therefore I
will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth
Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim—the glory of that land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21094">10</sup> I will give
Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a
possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the
nations; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21095">11</sup> and I
will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the
LORD.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Edom</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21096">12</sup> “This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Edom took revenge on the
house of Judah and became very guilty by doing so, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21097">13</sup> therefore this is what
the Sovereign LORD says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom
and kill its men and their animals. I will lay it waste, and from
Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21098">14</sup> I will take vengeance on Edom by the
hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in
accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance,
declares the Sovereign LORD.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Philistia</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21099">15</sup> “This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in
vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with
ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21100">16</sup> therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the
Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy those
remaining along the coast. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21101">17</sup> I will carry out great vengeance on
them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the
LORD, when I take vengeance on them.’”</div>
