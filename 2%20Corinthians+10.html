<h4>2 Corinthians 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Defense of His Ministry</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28957">1</sup> By the
meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am
“timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” when away!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28958">2</sup> I beg you that
when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward
some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28959">3</sup> For though we
live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28960">4</sup> The weapons we
fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they
have divine power to demolish strongholds. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28961">5</sup> We demolish arguments and every
pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we
take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28962">6</sup> And we will be
ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is
complete.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28963">7</sup> You
are looking only on the surface of things.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28963a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> If anyone is confident that he
belongs to Christ, he should consider again that we belong to
Christ just as much as he. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28964">8</sup> For even if I boast somewhat freely
about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather
than pulling you down, I will not be ashamed of it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28965">9</sup> I do not want to seem to
be trying to frighten you with my letters. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28966">10</sup> For some say, “His letters are
weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his
speaking amounts to nothing.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28967">11</sup> Such people should realize that what we
are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions
when we are present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28968">12</sup> We do
not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend
themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare
themselves with themselves, they are not wise. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28969">13</sup> We, however, will not
boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the
field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28970">14</sup> We are not
going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not
come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of
Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28971">15</sup>
Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by
others.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28971b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Our hope is that, as your faith
continues to grow, our area of activity among you will greatly
expand, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28972">16</sup> so
that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do
not want to boast about work already done in another man’s
territory. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28973">17</sup>
But, “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28973c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28974">18</sup> For it is not the one who commends
himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</p>
