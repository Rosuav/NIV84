<h4>Acts 18</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">In Corinth</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27546">1</sup> After
this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27547">2</sup> There he met a Jew named Aquila, a
native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife
Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome.
Paul went to see them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27548">3</sup> and because he was a tentmaker as they
were, he stayed and worked with them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27549">4</sup> Every Sabbath he reasoned in the
synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27550">5</sup> When
Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself
exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the
Christ.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27550a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27551">6</sup> But when the Jews opposed Paul and
became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to
them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my
responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27552">7</sup> Then
Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius
Justus, a worshiper of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27553">8</sup> Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his
entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians
who heard him believed and were baptized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27554">9</sup> One
night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: <font class='woj'>“Do not
be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27555">10</sup> For I am
with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I
have many people in this city.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27556">11</sup> So Paul stayed for a year and a half,
teaching them the word of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27557">12</sup> While
Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on
Paul and brought him into court. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27558">13</sup> “This man,” they charged, “is
persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the
law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27559">14</sup> Just
as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If you Jews
were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it
would be reasonable for me to listen to you. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27560">15</sup> But since it involves questions
about words and names and your own law—settle the matter
yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27561">16</sup> So he had them ejected
from the court. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27562">17</sup> Then they all turned on Sosthenes the
synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio
showed no concern whatever.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Priscilla, Aquila and Apollos</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27563">18</sup> Paul
stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and
sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he
sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had
taken. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27564">19</sup> They
arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He
himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27565">20</sup> When they
asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27566">21</sup> But as he left, he
promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail
from Ephesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27567">22</sup>
When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and
then went down to Antioch.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27568">23</sup> After
spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled
from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia,
strengthening all the disciples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27569">24</sup>
Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to
Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the
Scriptures. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27570">25</sup> He
had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great
fervor<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27570b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and taught about Jesus accurately,
though he knew only the baptism of John. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27571">26</sup> He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to
their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27572">27</sup> When
Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and
wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a
great help to those who by grace had believed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27573">28</sup> For he vigorously refuted
the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus
was the Christ.</p>
