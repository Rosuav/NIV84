<h4>Numbers 10</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Silver Trumpets</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3990">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3991">2</sup> “Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3992">3</sup> When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3993">4</sup> If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3994">5</sup> When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3995">6</sup> At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3996">7</sup> To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the same signal. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3997">8</sup> “The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3998">9</sup> When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3999">10</sup> Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed feasts and New Moon festivals—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3999a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Israelites Leave Sinai</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4000">11</sup> On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4001">12</sup> Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4002">13</sup> They set out, this first time, at the LORD’s command through Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4003">14</sup> The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4004">15</sup> Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4005">16</sup> and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4006">17</sup> Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4007">18</sup> The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4008">19</sup> Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4009">20</sup> and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4010">21</sup> Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4011">22</sup> The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4012">23</sup> Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4013">24</sup> and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4014">25</sup> Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4015">26</sup> Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4016">27</sup> and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4017">28</sup> This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4018">29</sup> Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4019">30</sup> He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4020">31</sup> But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4021">32</sup> If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4022">33</sup> So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4023">34</sup> The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4024">35</sup> Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Rise up, O LORD! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May your enemies be scattered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may your foes flee before you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4025">36</sup> Whenever it came to rest, he said, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Return, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the countless thousands of Israel.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-3999a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-3999" title="Ir a Numbers 10:10">Numbers 10:10</a> Traditionally <i>peace offerings</i></li>
