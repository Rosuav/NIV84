<h4>2 Peter 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30465">1</sup> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30466">2</sup> Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. <h5 class="passage-header">Making One’s Calling and Election Sure</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30467">3</sup> His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30468">4</sup> Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30469">5</sup> For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30470">6</sup> and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30471">7</sup> and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30472">8</sup> For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30473">9</sup> But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30474">10</sup> Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30475">11</sup> and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. <h5 class="passage-header">Prophecy of Scripture</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30476">12</sup> So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30477">13</sup> I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30478">14</sup> because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30479">15</sup> And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30480">16</sup> We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30481">17</sup> For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30481a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30482">18</sup> We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30483">19</sup> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30484">20</sup> Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30485">21</sup> For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30481a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30481" title="Ir a 2 Peter 1:17">2 Peter 1:17</a> Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35</li>
