<h4>2 Chronicles 14</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11477">1</sup> And
Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was
at peace for ten years.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Asa King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11478">2</sup> Asa did
what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11479">3</sup> He removed the
foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and
cut down the Asherah poles.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11479a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11480">4</sup> He commanded
Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to obey his
laws and commands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11481">5</sup> He removed the high places and incense
altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11482">6</sup> He built
up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No
one was at war with him during those years, for the LORD gave him
rest.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11483">7</sup> “Let
us build up these towns,” he said to Judah, “and put walls around
them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because
we have sought the LORD our God; we sought him and he has given us
rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11484">8</sup> Asa
had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with
large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand
from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these
were brave fighting men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11485">9</sup> Zerah
the Cushite marched out against them with a vast army<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11485b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and three hundred chariots, and
came as far as Mareshah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11486">10</sup> Asa went out to meet him, and they took
up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11487">11</sup> Then
Asa called to the LORD his God and said, “LORD, there is no one
like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD
our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against
this vast army. O LORD, you are our God; do not let man prevail
against you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11488">12</sup> The
LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites
fled, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11489">13</sup> and Asa
and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of
Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before
the LORD and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large
amount of plunder. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11490">14</sup> They destroyed all the villages around
Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They
plundered all these villages, since there was much booty there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11491">15</sup> They also
attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep
and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
