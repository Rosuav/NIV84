<h4>Mark 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Tenants</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24668">1</sup> He then
began to speak to them in parables: <font class='woj'>“A man
planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the
winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to
some farmers and went away on a journey.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24669">2</sup> At
harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them
some of the fruit of the vineyard.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24670">3</sup> But they
seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24671">4</sup> Then he sent another servant to them;
they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24672">5</sup> He sent still another, and that one they
killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they
killed.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24673">6</sup> “He had one left to send, a son, whom he
loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my
son.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24674">7</sup> “But the tenants said to one another,
‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will
be ours.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24675">8</sup> So they took him and killed him, and
threw him out of the vineyard.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24676">9</sup> “What then will the owner of the
vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the
vineyard to others.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24677">10</sup> Haven’t you read this
scripture:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘The stone the builders
rejected</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>has become the
capstone<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24677a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>;</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24678">11</sup> the Lord has done this,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and it is marvelous in our
eyes’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24678b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24679">12</sup> Then
they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken
the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so
they left him and went away.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paying Taxes to Caesar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24680">13</sup> Later
they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him
in his words. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24681">14</sup>
They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know you are a man of
integrity. You aren’t swayed by men, because you pay no attention
to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with
the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24682">15</sup> Should we pay or
shouldn’t we?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. <font class=
'woj'>“Why are you trying to trap me?”</font> he asked.
<font class='woj'>“Bring me a denarius and let me look at
it.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24683">16</sup>
They brought the coin, and he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Whose
portrait is this? And whose inscription?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Caesar’s,” they replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24684">17</sup> Then
Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Give to Caesar what is
Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were amazed at him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Marriage at the Resurrection</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24685">18</sup> Then the
Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a
question. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24686">19</sup>
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother
dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the
widow and have children for his brother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24687">20</sup> Now there were seven brothers. The
first one married and died without leaving any children.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24688">21</sup> The second one
married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the
same with the third. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24689">22</sup> In fact, none of the seven left any
children. Last of all, the woman died too. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24690">23</sup> At the resurrection<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24690c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> whose wife will she be, since the
seven were married to her?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24691">24</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Are you not in error because you do not
know the Scriptures or the power of God?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24692">25</sup> When the
dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they
will be like the angels in heaven.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24693">26</sup> Now
about the dead rising—have you not read in the book of Moses, in
the account of the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24693d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24694">27</sup> He is not the God of the
dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Greatest Commandment</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24695">28</sup> One of
the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that
Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the
commandments, which is the most important?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24696">29</sup> “The most important one,”</font>
answered Jesus, <font class='woj'>“is this: ‘Hear, O Israel, the
Lord our God, the Lord is one.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24696e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24697">30</sup> Love the Lord your God with all your
heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all
your strength.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24697f"
title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24698">31</sup> The
second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24698g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> There is no commandment greater than
these.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24699">32</sup> “Well
said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God
is one and there is no other but him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24700">33</sup> To love him with all your heart, with
all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your
neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and
sacrifices.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24701">34</sup> When
Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, <font class=
'woj'>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</font> And from
then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Whose Son Is the Christ?</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24702">35</sup> While
Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, <font class=
'woj'>“How is it that the teachers of the law say that the
Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24702h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> is the son of David?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24703">36</sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy
Spirit, declared:</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘The Lord said to my
Lord:</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Sit at my right
hand</font><br>
<font class='woj'>until I put your enemies</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>under your feet.”’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24703i" title=
"See footnote i">i</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24704">37</sup> David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How
then can he be his son?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large crowd listened to him with
delight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24705">38</sup> As he
taught, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Watch out for the teachers
of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be
greeted in the marketplaces,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24706">39</sup> and have the most
important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at
banquets.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24707">40</sup> They devour widows’ houses and for a
show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most
severely.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Widow’s Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24708">41</sup> Jesus
sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and
watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.
Many rich people threw in large amounts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24709">42</sup> But a poor widow came and put in two
very small copper coins,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24709j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> worth
only a fraction of a penny.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24709k" title="See footnote k">k</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24710">43</sup>
Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“I tell
you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than
all the others.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24711">44</sup> They all gave out of their wealth; but
she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live
on.”</font></p>
