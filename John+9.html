<p><h4>John 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26431">1</sup> As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26432">2</sup> His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26433">3</sup> “Neither this man nor his parents sinned,”</font> said Jesus, <font class='woj'>“but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26434">4</sup> As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26435">5</sup> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26436">6</sup> Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26437">7</sup> “Go,”</font> he told him, <font class='woj'>“wash in the Pool of Siloam”</font> (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26438">8</sup> His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26439">9</sup> Some claimed that he was. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he himself insisted, “I am the man.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26440">10</sup> “How then were your eyes opened?” they demanded. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26441">11</sup> He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26442">12</sup> “Where is this man?” they asked him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know,” he said. <h5 class="passage-header">The Pharisees Investigate the Healing</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26443">13</sup> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26444">14</sup> Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26445">15</sup> Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26446">16</sup> Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But others asked, “How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?” So they were divided. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26447">17</sup> Finally they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man replied, “He is a prophet.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26448">18</sup> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26449">19</sup> “Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26450">20</sup> “We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26451">21</sup> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26452">22</sup> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26452a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> would be put out of the synagogue. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26453">23</sup> That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26454">24</sup> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26454b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26455">25</sup> He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26456">26</sup> Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26457">27</sup> He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26458">28</sup> Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26459">29</sup> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26460">30</sup> The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26461">31</sup> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26462">32</sup> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26463">33</sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26464">34</sup> To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out. <h5 class="passage-header">Spiritual Blindness</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26465">35</sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, <font class='woj'>“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26466">36</sup> “Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26467">37</sup> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26468">38</sup> Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26469">39</sup> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26470">40</sup> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26471">41</sup> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-26452a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-26452" title="Go to John 9:22">John 9:22</a> Or <i>Messiah</i></li>
