<h4>2 Kings 22</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Book of the Law Found</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10147">1</sup> Josiah
was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter
of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10148">2</sup> He did what was right in the eyes of the
LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning
aside to the right or to the left.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10149">3</sup> In the
eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary,
Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the
LORD. He said: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10150">4</sup>
“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money
that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the
doorkeepers have collected from the people. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10151">5</sup> Have them entrust it to the men
appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men
pay the workers who repair the temple of the LORD— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10152">6</sup> the carpenters, the
builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed
stone to repair the temple. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10153">7</sup> But they need not account for the money
entrusted to them, because they are acting faithfully.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10154">8</sup>
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have
found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD.” He gave it to
Shaphan, who read it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10155">9</sup> Then Shaphan the secretary went to the
king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money
that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the
workers and supervisors at the temple.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10156">10</sup> Then Shaphan the secretary informed the
king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read
from it in the presence of the king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10157">11</sup> When
the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10158">12</sup> He gave these
orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of
Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10159">13</sup> “Go and
inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah
about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is
the LORD’s anger that burns against us because our fathers have not
obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance
with all that is written there concerning us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10160">14</sup>
Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak
to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of
Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in
Jerusalem, in the Second District.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10161">15</sup> She
said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell
the man who sent you to me, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10162">16</sup> ‘This is what the LORD says: I am going
to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to
everything written in the book the king of Judah has read.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10163">17</sup> Because they
have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me
to anger by all the idols their hands have made,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10163a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> my anger will burn against this
place and will not be quenched.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10164">18</sup> Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to
inquire of the LORD, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel,
says concerning the words you heard: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10165">19</sup> Because your heart was responsive and
you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have
spoken against this place and its people, that they would become
accursed and laid waste, and because you tore your robes and wept
in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10166">20</sup> Therefore I will gather
you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes
will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this
place.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they took her answer back to the king.</p>
