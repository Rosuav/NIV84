<h4>James 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30252">1</sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings. <h5 class="passage-header">Trials and Temptations</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30253">2</sup> Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30254">3</sup> because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30255">4</sup> Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30256">5</sup> If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30257">6</sup> But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30258">7</sup> That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30259">8</sup> he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30260">9</sup> The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30261">10</sup> But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30262">11</sup> For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30263">12</sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30264">13</sup> When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30265">14</sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30266">15</sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30267">16</sup> Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30268">17</sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30269">18</sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <h5 class="passage-header">Listening and Doing</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30270">19</sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30271">20</sup> for man’s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30272">21</sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30273">22</sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30274">23</sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30275">24</sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30276">25</sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it—he will be blessed in what he does. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30277">26</sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30278">27</sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world. </div></body></html>
