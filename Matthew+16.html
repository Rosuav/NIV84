<h4>Matthew 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Demand for a Sign</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23674">1</sup> The
Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him
to show them a sign from heaven.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23675">2</sup> He
replied,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23675a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <font class='woj'>“When evening
comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is
red,’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23676">3</sup> and in the morning, ‘Today it will be
stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret
the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of
the times.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23677">4</sup> A wicked and adulterous generation looks
for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of
Jonah.”</font> Jesus then left them and went away.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23678">5</sup> When they
went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23679">6</sup> “Be careful,”</font> Jesus said to them.
<font class='woj'>“Be on your guard against the yeast of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23680">7</sup> They
discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t
bring any bread.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23681">8</sup> Aware
of their discussion, Jesus asked, <font class='woj'>“You of little
faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no
bread?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23682">9</sup> Do you still not understand? Don’t you
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many
basketfuls you gathered?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23683">10</sup> Or the seven loaves for
the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23684">11</sup> How is it you don’t understand that I
was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against
the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23685">12</sup> Then they understood that
he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread,
but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter’s Confession of Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23686">13</sup> When
Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, <font class='woj'>“Who do people say the Son of Man
is?”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23687">14</sup> They
replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still
others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23688">15</sup> “But what about you?”</font> he asked.
<font class='woj'>“Who do you say I am?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23689">16</sup> Simon
Peter answered, “You are the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23689b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the Son
of the living God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23690">17</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah,
for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in
heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23691">18</sup> And I tell you that you are
Peter,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23691c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and on this rock I will build my
church, and the gates of Hades<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23691d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> will not
overcome it.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23691e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23692">19</sup> I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on
earth will be<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23692f"
title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> bound in heaven, and whatever
you loose on earth will be<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23692g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> loosed in
heaven.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23693">20</sup> Then he warned his disciples not to
tell anyone that he was the Christ.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Predicts His Death</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23694">21</sup> From
that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must
go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders,
chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed
and on the third day be raised to life.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23695">22</sup> Peter
took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said.
“This shall never happen to you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23696">23</sup> Jesus
turned and said to Peter, <font class='woj'>“Get behind me, Satan!
You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things
of God, but the things of men.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23697">24</sup> Then
Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“If anyone would
come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23698">25</sup> For whoever wants to save his
life<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23698h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> will lose it, but whoever loses his
life for me will find it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23699">26</sup> What good will it be for
a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what
can a man give in exchange for his soul?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23700">27</sup> For the
Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels,
and then he will reward each person according to what he has
done.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23701">28</sup> I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man
coming in his kingdom.”</font></p>
