<h4>Romans 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Weak and the Strong</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28267">1</sup> Accept
him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable
matters. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28268">2</sup> One
man’s faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose
faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28269">3</sup> The man who eats everything must not
look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat
everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28270">4</sup> Who are
you to judge someone else’s servant? To his own master he stands or
falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28271">5</sup> One
man considers one day more sacred than another; another man
considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in
his own mind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28272">6</sup>
He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats
meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who
abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28273">7</sup> For none of us lives to
himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28274">8</sup> If we live, we live to the
Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or
die, we belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28275">9</sup> For
this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might
be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28276">10</sup> You, then, why do you judge your
brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all
stand before God’s judgment seat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28277">11</sup> It is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord,<br>
‘every knee will bow before me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every tongue will confess to God.’”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28277a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28278">12</sup> So
then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28279">13</sup>
Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead,
make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in
your brother’s way. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28280">14</sup> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am
fully convinced that no food<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28280b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> is
unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then
for him it is unclean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28281">15</sup> If your brother is distressed because
of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your
eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28282">16</sup> Do not allow what you
consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28283">17</sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter
of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the
Holy Spirit, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28284">18</sup>
because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and
approved by men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28285">19</sup> Let
us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to
mutual edification. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28286">20</sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the
sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat
anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28287">21</sup> It is better not to eat meat or
drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to
fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28288">22</sup> So
whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and
God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he
approves. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28289">23</sup> But
the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating
is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is
sin.</p>
