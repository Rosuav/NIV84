<p><h4>Amos 7</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Locusts, Fire and a Plumb Line</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22466">1</sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22467">2</sup> When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22468">3</sup> So the LORD relented. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This will not happen,” the LORD said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22469">4</sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22470">5</sup> Then I cried out, “Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22471">6</sup> So the LORD relented. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This will not happen either,” the Sovereign LORD said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22472">7</sup> This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22473">8</sup> And the LORD asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A plumb line,” I replied. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22474">9</sup> “The high places of Isaac will be destroyed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.” <h5 class="passage-header">Amos and Amaziah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22475">10</sup> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22476">11</sup> For this is what Amos is saying: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Israel will surely go into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from their native land.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22477">12</sup> Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22478">13</sup> Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22479">14</sup> Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor a prophet’s son, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22480">15</sup> But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22481">16</sup> Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Do not prophesy against Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22482">17</sup> “Therefore this is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. <br />Your land will be measured and divided up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you yourself will die in a pagan<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22482a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> country. <br />And Israel will certainly go into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from their native land.’” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22482a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22482" title="Go to Amos 7:17">Amos 7:17</a> Hebrew <i>an unclean</i></li>
