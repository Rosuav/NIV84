<h4>2 Samuel 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ish-Bosheth Murdered</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8122">1</sup> When
Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he
lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8123">2</sup> Now Saul’s son had two men who were
leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Recab;
they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of
Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8124">3</sup> because the people of
Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have lived there as aliens to this day.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8125">4</sup>
(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was
five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from
Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to
leave, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8126">5</sup> Now
Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for
the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the
day while he was taking his noonday rest. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8127">6</sup> They went into the inner part of the
house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach.
Then Recab and his brother Baanah slipped away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8128">7</sup> They
had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his
bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head.
Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8129">8</sup> They brought the
head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here
is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to
take your life. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king
against Saul and his offspring.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8130">9</sup> David
answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out
of all trouble, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8131">10</sup>
when a man told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing
good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was
the reward I gave him for his news! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8132">11</sup> How much more—when wicked men have
killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed—should I
not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of
you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8133">12</sup> So
David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off
their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But
they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb at
Hebron.</p>
