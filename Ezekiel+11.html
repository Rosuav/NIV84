<p><h4>Ezekiel 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Judgment on Israel’s Leaders</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20657">1</sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20658">2</sup> The LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20659">3</sup> They say, ‘Will it not soon be time to build houses?<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20659a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20660">4</sup> Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20661">5</sup> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon me, and he told me to say: “This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, O house of Israel, but I know what is going through your mind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20662">6</sup> You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20663">7</sup> “Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20664">8</sup> You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20665">9</sup> I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20666">10</sup> You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20667">11</sup> This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20668">12</sup> And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20669">13</sup> Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Ah, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20670">14</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20671">15</sup> “Son of man, your brothers—your brothers who are your blood relatives<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20671b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and the whole house of Israel—are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, ‘They are<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20671c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.’ <h5 class="passage-header">Promised Return of Israel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20672">16</sup> “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20673">17</sup> “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20674">18</sup> “They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20675">19</sup> I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20676">20</sup> Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20677">21</sup> But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20678">22</sup> Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20679">23</sup> The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20680">24</sup> The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20680d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> in the vision given by the Spirit of God. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the vision I had seen went up from me, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20681">25</sup> and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20659a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20659" title="Go to Ezekiel 11:3">Ezekiel 11:3</a> Or <i>This is not the time to build houses.</i></li>
