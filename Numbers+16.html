<h5 class="passage-header">Korah, Dathan and Abiram</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4196">1</sup> Korah son
of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain
Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of
Peleth—became insolent<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-4196a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4197">2</sup> and rose up
against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known
community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4198">3</sup> They came as a
group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have gone
too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the
LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD’s
assembly?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4199">4</sup> When
Moses heard this, he fell facedown. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4200">5</sup> Then he said to Korah and all his
followers: “In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him
and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The
man he chooses he will cause to come near him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4201">6</sup> You, Korah, and all your
followers are to do this: Take censers <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4202">7</sup> and tomorrow put fire and incense in them
before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is
holy. You Levites have gone too far!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4203">8</sup> Moses
also said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites! <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4204">9</sup> Isn’t it enough for you that the God
of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite
community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD’s
tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4205">10</sup> He has brought
you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are
trying to get the priesthood too. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4206">11</sup> It is against the LORD that you and all
your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should
grumble against him?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4207">12</sup> Then
Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said,
“We will not come! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4208">13</sup> Isn’t it enough that you have brought us
up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the
desert? And now you also want to lord it over us? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4209">14</sup> Moreover, you haven’t
brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an
inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes
of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4209b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> these men? No, we will not
come!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4210">15</sup> Then
Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not accept their
offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have
I wronged any of them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4211">16</sup> Moses
said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the
LORD tomorrow—you and they and Aaron. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4212">17</sup> Each man is to take his censer and put
incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the LORD.
You and Aaron are to present your censers also.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4213">18</sup> So each man took his
censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron
at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4214">19</sup> When Korah had gathered all his
followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4215">20</sup> The LORD said
to Moses and Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4216">21</sup> “Separate yourselves from this assembly
so I can put an end to them at once.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4217">22</sup> But
Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, God of the
spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly
when only one man sins?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4218">23</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4219">24</sup> “Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from
the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4220">25</sup> Moses
got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel
followed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4221">26</sup>
He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked
men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept
away because of all their sins.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4222">27</sup> So they moved away from the tents of
Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were
standing with their wives, children and little ones at the
entrances to their tents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4223">28</sup> Then
Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to
do all these things and that it was not my idea: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4224">29</sup> If these men die a natural
death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the
LORD has not sent me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4225">30</sup> But if the LORD brings about something
totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with
everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the
grave,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4225c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> then you will know that these men
have treated the LORD with contempt.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4226">31</sup> As
soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split
apart <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4227">32</sup> and the
earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households
and all Korah’s men and all their possessions. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4228">33</sup> They went down alive into
the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them,
and they perished and were gone from the community. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4229">34</sup> At their cries, all the
Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth is going to
swallow us too!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4230">35</sup> And
fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were
offering the incense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4231">36</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4232">37</sup> “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,
to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the
coals some distance away, for the censers are holy— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4233">38</sup> the censers of the men who
sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets
to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and
have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4234">39</sup> So
Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those
who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the
altar, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4235">40</sup> as the
LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites
that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn
incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his
followers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4236">41</sup> The
next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and
Aaron. “You have killed the LORD’s people,” they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4237">42</sup> But
when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and
turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it
and the glory of the LORD appeared. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4238">43</sup> Then Moses and Aaron went to the front
of the Tent of Meeting, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4239">44</sup> and the LORD said to Moses, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4240">45</sup> “Get away from this
assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And they fell
facedown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4241">46</sup> Then
Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along
with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make
atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague
has started.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4242">47</sup>
So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly.
The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered
the incense and made atonement for them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4243">48</sup> He stood between the living and the
dead, and the plague stopped. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4244">49</sup> But 14,700 people died from the plague,
in addition to those who had died because of Korah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4245">50</sup> Then Aaron returned to
Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had
stopped.</p>
