<p><h4>Mark 10</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Divorce</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24584">1</sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24585">2</sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24586">3</sup> “What did Moses command you?”</font> he replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24587">4</sup> They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24588">5</sup> “It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24589">6</sup> “But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24589a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24590">7</sup> ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24590b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24591">8</sup> and the two will become one flesh.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24591c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> So they are no longer two, but one.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24592">9</sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24593">10</sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24594">11</sup> He answered, <font class='woj'>“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24595">12</sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Little Children and Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24596">13</sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24597">14</sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, <font class='woj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24598">15</sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24599">16</sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <h5 class="passage-header">The Rich Young Man</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24600">17</sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24601">18</sup> “Why do you call me good?”</font> Jesus answered. <font class='woj'>“No one is good—except God alone.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24602">19</sup> You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24602d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24603">20</sup> “Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24604">21</sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. <font class='woj'>“One thing you lack,”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24605">22</sup> At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24606">23</sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24607">24</sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, <font class='woj'>“Children, how hard it is<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24607e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> to enter the kingdom of God!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24608">25</sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24609">26</sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24610">27</sup> Jesus looked at them and said, <font class='woj'>“With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24611">28</sup> Peter said to him, “We have left everything to follow you!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24612">29</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24613">30</sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24614">31</sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Again Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24615">32</sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24616">33</sup> “We are going up to Jerusalem,”</font> he said, <font class='woj'>“and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24617">34</sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Request of James and John</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24618">35</sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24619">36</sup> “What do you want me to do for you?”</font> he asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24620">37</sup> They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24621">38</sup> “You don’t know what you are asking,”</font> Jesus said. <font class='woj'>“Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24622">39</sup> “We can,” they answered. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24623">40</sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24624">41</sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24625">42</sup> Jesus called them together and said, <font class='woj'>“You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24626">43</sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24627">44</sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24628">45</sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24629">46</sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24630">47</sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24631">48</sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24632">49</sup> Jesus stopped and said, <font class='woj'>“Call him.”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24633">50</sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24634">51</sup> “What do you want me to do for you?”</font> Jesus asked him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to see.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24635">52</sup> “Go,”</font> said Jesus, <font class='woj'>“your faith has healed you.”</font> Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24589a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24589" title="Go to Mark 10:6">Mark 10:6</a> Gen. 1:27</li>
