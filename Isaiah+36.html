<h5 class="passage-header">Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18332">1</sup> In the
fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of
Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18333">2</sup> Then the
king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from
Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped
at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman’s
Field, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18334">3</sup> Eliakim
son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and
Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18335">4</sup> The
field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘This is what the great king, the king of
Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18336">5</sup> You say you
have strategy and military strength—but you speak only empty words.
On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18337">6</sup> Look now, you are
depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces
a man’s hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king
of Egypt to all who depend on him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18338">7</sup> And if you say to me, “We are depending
on the LORD our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars
Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship
before this altar”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18339">8</sup> “‘Come
now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will
give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18340">9</sup> How then can
you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even
though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18341">10</sup> Furthermore,
have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The
LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy
it.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18342">11</sup> Then
Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak
to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to
us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18343">12</sup> But
the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my
master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on
the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink
their own urine?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18344">13</sup> Then
the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of
the great king, the king of Assyria! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18345">14</sup> This is what the king says: Do not let
Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-18346">15</sup> Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to
trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us;
this city will not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18347">16</sup> “Do
not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make
peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat
from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own
cistern, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18348">17</sup> until
I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new
wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18349">18</sup> “Do
not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver
us.’ Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the
hand of the king of Assyria? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18350">19</sup> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?
Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my
hand? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18351">20</sup> Who of
all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from
me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18352">21</sup> But
the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the
king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18353">22</sup> Then
Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the
secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah,
with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had
said.</p>
