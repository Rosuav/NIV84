Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering
at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and
sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of hides of
sea cows and put its poles in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3759">15</sup> “After
Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and
all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, the
Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch
the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those
things that are in the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3760">16</sup>
“Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for
the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the

not cut off from the Levites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3763">19</sup> So that they may live and not die when
they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and
his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his
work and what he is to carry. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3764">20</sup> But the Kohathites must not go in to
look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.”</p>

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3767">23</sup> Count all the
men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work
at the Tent of Meeting.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3768">24</sup> “This

burdens: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3769">25</sup> They
are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting,
its covering and the outer covering of hides of sea cows, the
curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, <sup class=

entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its service. The
Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3771">27</sup> All their
service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under
the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as
their responsibility all they are to carry. <sup class="versenum"

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3776">32</sup> as well as the
posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs,

direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.”
<h5 class="passage-header">The Numbering of the Levite Clans</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3778">34</sup> Moses,
Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by
their clans and families. <sup class="versenum" id=

of age who came to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3780">36</sup> counted by
clans, were 2,750. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3781">37</sup> This was the total of all those in the
Kohathite clans who served in the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron
counted them according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3782">38</sup> The
Gershonites were counted by their clans and families. <sup class=

"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3785">41</sup> This was the total of
those in the Gershonite clans who served at the Tent of Meeting.
Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD’s command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3786">42</sup> The

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they were counted, as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
