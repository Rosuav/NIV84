<p><h4>Colossians 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Rules for Holy Living</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29503">1</sup> Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29504">2</sup> Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29505">3</sup> For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29506">4</sup> When Christ, who is your<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29506a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29507">5</sup> Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29508">6</sup> Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29508b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29509">7</sup> You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29510">8</sup> But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29511">9</sup> Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29512">10</sup> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29513">11</sup> Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29514">12</sup> Therefore, as Godâ€™s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29515">13</sup> Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29516">14</sup> And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29517">15</sup> Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29518">16</sup> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29519">17</sup> And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. <h5 class="passage-header">Rules for Christian Households</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29520">18</sup> Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29521">19</sup> Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29522">20</sup> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29523">21</sup> Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29524">22</sup> Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29525">23</sup> Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29526">24</sup> since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29527">25</sup> Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29506a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29506" title="Go to Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</a> Some manuscripts <i>our</i></li>
