<h4>John 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Healing at the Pool</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26202">1</sup> Some time
later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26203">2</sup> Now there is in
Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called
Bethesda<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26203a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and which is surrounded by five
covered colonnades. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26204">3</sup> Here a great number of disabled people
used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26204b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26205">5</sup> One who was there had been an invalid
for thirty-eight years. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26206">6</sup> When Jesus saw him lying there and
learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he
asked him, <font class='woj'>“Do you want to get well?”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26207">7</sup> “Sir,”
the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when
the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else
goes down ahead of me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26208">8</sup> Then
Jesus said to him, <font class='woj'>“Get up! Pick up your mat and
walk.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26209">9</sup>
At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day on which this took place was a
Sabbath, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26210">10</sup> and
so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the
Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26211">11</sup> But
he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, <font class=
'woj'>‘Pick up your mat and walk.’</font> ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26212">12</sup> So
they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and
walk?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26213">13</sup> The
man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped
away into the crowd that was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26214">14</sup> Later
Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, <font class=
'woj'>“See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may
happen to you.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26215">15</sup> The man went away and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him well.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Life Through the Son</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26216">16</sup> So,
because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews
persecuted him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26217">17</sup> Jesus said to them, <font class=
'woj'>“My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I,
too, am working.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26218">18</sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the
harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he
was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26219">19</sup> Jesus
gave them this answer: <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, the
Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his
Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also
does.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26220">20</sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows
him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even
greater things than these.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26221">21</sup> For just as the Father
raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to
whom he is pleased to give it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26222">22</sup> Moreover, the Father
judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26223">23</sup> that all may honor the Son just as they
honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the
Father, who sent him.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26224">24</sup> “I tell you the truth, whoever hears my
word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be
condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26225">25</sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming
and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of
God and those who hear will live.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26226">26</sup> For as
the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have
life in himself.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26227">27</sup> And he has given him authority to judge
because he is the Son of Man.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26228">28</sup> “Do not be amazed at this, for a time
is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his
voice</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26229">29</sup> and come out—those who have done good
will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be
condemned.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26230">30</sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge
only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please
myself but him who sent me.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Testimonies About Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26231">31</sup> “If I testify about myself, my
testimony is not valid.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26232">32</sup> There is another who
testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is
valid.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26233">33</sup> “You have sent to John and he has
testified to the truth.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26234">34</sup> Not that I accept human
testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26235">35</sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave
light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26236">36</sup> “I have testimony weightier than that
of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish,
and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26237">37</sup> And the Father who sent me has himself
testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen
his form,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26238">38</sup> nor does his word dwell in you, for you
do not believe the one he sent.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26239">39</sup> You
diligently study<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26239c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the
Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life.
These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26240">40</sup> yet you
refuse to come to me to have life.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26241">41</sup> “I do not accept praise from
men,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26242">42</sup> but I know you. I know that you do not
have the love of God in your hearts.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26243">43</sup> I have
come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone
else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26244">44</sup> How can you believe if you accept
praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise
that comes from the only God<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26244d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26245">45</sup> “But do not think I will accuse you
before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are
set.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26246">46</sup> If you believed Moses, you would
believe me, for he wrote about me.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26247">47</sup> But
since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to
believe what I say?”</font></p>
