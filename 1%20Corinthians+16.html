<h4>1 Corinthians 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Collection for God’s People</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28762">1</sup> Now about
the collection for God’s people: Do what I told the Galatian
churches to do. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28763">2</sup>
On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a
sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when
I come no collections will have to be made. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28764">3</sup> Then, when I arrive, I will give
letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with
your gift to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28765">4</sup> If it seems advisable for me to go also,
they will accompany me.
<h5 class="passage-header">Personal Requests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28766">5</sup> After I
go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going
through Macedonia. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28767">6</sup> Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or
even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey,
wherever I go. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28768">7</sup>
I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope
to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28769">8</sup> But I will stay on at
Ephesus until Pentecost, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28770">9</sup> because a great door for effective work
has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28771">10</sup> If
Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is
with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28772">11</sup> No one, then,
should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that
he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the
brothers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28773">12</sup> Now
about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with
the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when
he has the opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28774">13</sup> Be on
your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28775">14</sup> Do everything
in love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28776">15</sup> You
know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in
Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the
saints. I urge you, brothers, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28777">16</sup> to submit to such as these and to
everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28778">17</sup> I was glad when
Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have
supplied what was lacking from you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28779">18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours
also. Such men deserve recognition.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28780">19</sup> The
churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and
Priscilla<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28780a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> greet you warmly in the
Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28781">20</sup> All the brothers here
send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28782">21</sup> I,
Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28783">22</sup> If
anyone does not love the Lord—a curse be on him. Come, O
Lord<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28783b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28784">23</sup> The
grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28785">24</sup> My
love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.<sup class=
