<h4>1 Corinthians 13</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28651">1</sup> If I speak in the tongues<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28651a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28652">2</sup> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28653">3</sup> If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28653b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> but have not love, I gain nothing. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28654">4</sup> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28655">5</sup> It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28656">6</sup> Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28657">7</sup> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28658">8</sup> Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28659">9</sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28660">10</sup> but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28661">11</sup> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28662">12</sup> Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28663">13</sup> And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28651a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28651" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a> Or <i>languages</i></li>
