<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Sower</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24322">1</sup> Again
Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around
him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the
lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s
edge. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24323">2</sup> He taught
them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24324">3</sup> “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his
seed.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24325">4</sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell
along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24326">5</sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did
not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was
shallow.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24327">6</sup> But when the sun came up, the plants
were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24328">7</sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew
up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24329">8</sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It
came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or
even a hundred times.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24330">9</sup> Then
Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“He who has ears to hear, let him
hear.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24331">10</sup> When
he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about
the parables. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24332">11</sup>
He told them, <font class='woj'>“The secret of the kingdom of God
has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is
said in parables</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24333">12</sup> so that,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘they may be ever seeing
but never perceiving,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and ever hearing but never
understanding;</font><br>
<font class='woj'>otherwise they might turn and be
forgiven!’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24333a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24334">13</sup> Then
Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Don’t you understand this
parable? How then will you understand any parable?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24335">14</sup> The farmer sows the word.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24336">15</sup> Some people are like seed along the
path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes
and takes away the word that was sown in them.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24337">16</sup> Others,
like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive
it with joy.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24338">17</sup> But since they have no root, they last
only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
word, they quickly fall away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24339">18</sup> Still others, like seed
sown among thorns, hear the word;</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24340">19</sup> but the
worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires
for other things come in and choke the word, making it
unfruitful.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24341">20</sup> Others, like seed sown on good soil,
hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—thirty, sixty or even
a hundred times what was sown.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Lamp on a Stand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24342">21</sup> He said
to them, <font class='woj'>“Do you bring in a lamp to put it under
a bowl or a bed? Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24343">22</sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be
disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out
into the open.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24344">23</sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24345">24</sup> “Consider carefully what you
hear,”</font> he continued. <font class='woj'>“With the measure you
use, it will be measured to you—and even more.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24346">25</sup> Whoever
has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has
will be taken from him.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Growing Seed</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24347">26</sup> He also
said, <font class='woj'>“This is what the kingdom of God is like. A
man scatters seed on the ground.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24348">27</sup> Night
and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows,
though he does not know how.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24349">28</sup> All by itself the soil
produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel
in the head.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24350">29</sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts
the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Mustard Seed</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24351">30</sup> Again he
said, <font class='woj'>“What shall we say the kingdom of God is
like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24352">31</sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the
smallest seed you plant in the ground.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24353">32</sup> Yet when
planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants,
with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its
shade.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24354">33</sup> With
many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they
could understand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24355">34</sup> He did not say anything to them without
using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he
explained everything.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Calms the Storm</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24356">35</sup> That day
when evening came, he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“Let
us go over to the other side.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24357">36</sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him
along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats
with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24358">37</sup> A
furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that
it was nearly swamped. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24359">38</sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a
cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t
you care if we drown?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24360">39</sup> He
got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, <font class=
'woj'>“Quiet! Be still!”</font> Then the wind died down and it was
completely calm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24361">40</sup> He
said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“Why are you so afraid? Do
you still have no faith?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24362">41</sup> They
were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind
and the waves obey him!”</p>
