<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23157">12</sup> After

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23162">17</sup> Thus
there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David,

<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Jesus Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23163">18</sup> This is
how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was
pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she
was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23164">19</sup> Because Joseph her
husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to
public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23165">20</sup> But
after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him
in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take
Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from
the Holy Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23166">21</sup> She will give birth to a son, and you
are to give him the name Jesus,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23166c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> because
he will save his people from their sins.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23167">22</sup> All
this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the
prophet: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23168">23</sup> “The
virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they
will call him Immanuel”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23168d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>—which
means, “God with us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23169">24</sup> When
Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him
and took Mary home as his wife. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23170">25</sup> But he had no union with her until she
gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p>
