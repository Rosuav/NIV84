<h4>Luke 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zacchaeus the Tax Collector</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25724">1</sup> Jesus
entered Jericho and was passing through. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25725">2</sup> A man was there by the name of
Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25726">3</sup> He wanted to
see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of
the crowd. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25727">4</sup> So
he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since
Jesus was coming that way.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25728">5</sup> When
Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, <font class=
'woj'>“Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house
today.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25729">6</sup>
So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25730">7</sup> All
the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the
guest of a ‘sinner.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25731">8</sup> But
Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now
I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated
anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the
amount.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25732">9</sup> Jesus
said to him, <font class='woj'>“Today salvation has come to this
house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25733">10</sup> For the Son of Man came to seek and to
save what was lost.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Ten Minas</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25734">11</sup> While
they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable,
because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the
kingdom of God was going to appear at once. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25735">12</sup> He said: <font class='woj'>“A man of
noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed
king and then to return.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25736">13</sup> So he called ten of his
servants and gave them ten minas.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25736a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> ‘Put this
money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25737">14</sup> “But his subjects hated him and sent a
delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our
king.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25738">15</sup> “He was made king, however, and
returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given
the money, in order to find out what they had gained with
it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25739">16</sup> “The first one came and said, ‘Sir,
your mina has earned ten more.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25740">17</sup> “‘Well done, my good servant!’ his
master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small
matter, take charge of ten cities.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25741">18</sup> “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your
mina has earned five more.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25742">19</sup> “His master answered, ‘You take charge
of five cities.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25743">20</sup> “Then another servant came and said,
‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of
cloth.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25744">21</sup> I was afraid of you, because you are a
hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you
did not sow.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25745">22</sup> “His master replied, ‘I will judge you
by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am
a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I
did not sow?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25746">23</sup> Why then didn’t you put my money on
deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with
interest?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25747">24</sup> “Then he said to those standing by,
‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten
minas.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25748">25</sup> “‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has
ten!’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25749">26</sup> “He replied, ‘I tell you that to
everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has
nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25750">27</sup> But
those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over
them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Triumphal Entry</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25751">28</sup> After
Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25752">29</sup> As he
approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25753">30</sup> “Go to
the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt
tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it
here.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25754">31</sup> If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you
untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25755">32</sup> Those
who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25756">33</sup> As they were
untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the
colt?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25757">34</sup> They
replied, “The Lord needs it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25758">35</sup> They
brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus
on it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25759">36</sup> As he
went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25760">37</sup> When
he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of
Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God
in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25761">38</sup>
“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25761b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Peace in heaven and glory in the
highest!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25762">39</sup> Some
of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your
disciples!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25763">40</sup> “I tell you,”</font> he replied,
<font class='woj'>“if they keep quiet, the stones will cry
out.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25764">41</sup> As he
approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25765">42</sup> and said, <font class=
'woj'>“If you, even you, had only known on this day what would
bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25766">43</sup> The days will come upon you when your
enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and
hem you in on every side.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25767">44</sup> They will dash you to the
ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave
one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of
God’s coming to you.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus at the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25768">45</sup> Then he
entered the temple area and began driving out those who were
selling. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25769">46</sup> “It is written,”</font> he said to
them, <font class='woj'>“‘My house will be a house of
prayer’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25769c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>; but you have made it ‘a den of
robbers.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25769d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25770">47</sup> Every
day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the
teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to
kill him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25771">48</sup> Yet
they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung
on his words.</p>
