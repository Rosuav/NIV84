<h4>Leviticus 14</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Cleansing From Infectious Skin Diseases</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3113">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3114">2</sup> “These are the regulations for the diseased person at the time of his ceremonial cleansing, when he is brought to the priest: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3115">3</sup> The priest is to go outside the camp and examine him. If the person has been healed of his infectious skin disease,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3115a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3116">4</sup> the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3117">5</sup> Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3118">6</sup> He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3119">7</sup> Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the infectious disease and pronounce him clean. Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3120">8</sup> “The person to be cleansed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair and bathe with water; then he will be ceremonially clean. After this he may come into the camp, but he must stay outside his tent for seven days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3121">9</sup> On the seventh day he must shave off all his hair; he must shave his head, his beard, his eyebrows and the rest of his hair. He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and he will be clean. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3122">10</sup> “On the eighth day he must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb a year old, each without defect, along with three-tenths of an ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3122b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3122c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of oil. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3123">11</sup> The priest who pronounces him clean shall present both the one to be cleansed and his offerings before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3124">12</sup> “Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the LORD as a wave offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3125">13</sup> He is to slaughter the lamb in the holy place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3126">14</sup> The priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3127">15</sup> The priest shall then take some of the log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own left hand, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3128">16</sup> dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of it before the LORD seven times. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3129">17</sup> The priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3130">18</sup> The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for him before the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3131">19</sup> “Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3132">20</sup> and offer it on the altar, together with the grain offering, and make atonement for him, and he will be clean. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3133">21</sup> “If, however, he is poor and cannot afford these, he must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for him, together with a tenth of an ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3133d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, a log of oil, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3134">22</sup> and two doves or two young pigeons, which he can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3135">23</sup> “On the eighth day he must bring them for his cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3136">24</sup> The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3137">25</sup> He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3138">26</sup> The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3139">27</sup> and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3140">28</sup> Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering—on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3141">29</sup> The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3142">30</sup> Then he shall sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons, which the person can afford, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3143">31</sup> one<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3143e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3144">32</sup> These are the regulations for anyone who has an infectious skin disease and who cannot afford the regular offerings for his cleansing. <h5 class="passage-header">Cleansing From Mildew</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3145">33</sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3146">34</sup> “When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in that land, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3147">35</sup> the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, ‘I have seen something that looks like mildew in my house.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3148">36</sup> The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mildew, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3149">37</sup> He is to examine the mildew on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3150">38</sup> the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3151">39</sup> On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3152">40</sup> he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3153">41</sup> He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3154">42</sup> Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3155">43</sup> “If the mildew reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3156">44</sup> the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mildew has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew; the house is unclean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3157">45</sup> It must be torn down—its stones, timbers and all the plaster—and taken out of the town to an unclean place. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3158">46</sup> “Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3159">47</sup> Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash his clothes. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3160">48</sup> “But if the priest comes to examine it and the mildew has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the mildew is gone. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3161">49</sup> To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3162">50</sup> He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3163">51</sup> Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3164">52</sup> He shall purify the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3165">53</sup> Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3166">54</sup> These are the regulations for any infectious skin disease, for an itch, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3167">55</sup> for mildew in clothing or in a house, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3168">56</sup> and for a swelling, a rash or a bright spot, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3169">57</sup> to determine when something is clean or unclean. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the regulations for infectious skin diseases and mildew. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-3115a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-3115" title="Ir a Leviticus 14:3">Leviticus 14:3</a> Traditionally <i>leprosy</i>; the Hebrew word was used for various diseases affecting the skin—not necessarily leprosy; also elsewhere in this chapter.</li>
