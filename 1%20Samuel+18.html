<h4>1 Samuel 18</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul’s Jealousy of David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7678">1</sup> After
David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit
with David, and he loved him as himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7679">2</sup> From that day Saul kept David with him
and did not let him return to his father’s house. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7680">3</sup> And Jonathan made a
covenant with David because he loved him as himself. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7681">4</sup> Jonathan took off the robe
he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even
his sword, his bow and his belt.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7682">5</sup>
Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so
successfully<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7682a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> that Saul gave him a high
rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul’s officers
as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7683">6</sup> When
the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine,
the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul
with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines
and lutes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7684">7</sup> As
they danced, they sang:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Saul has slain his thousands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David his tens of thousands.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7685">8</sup> Saul
was very angry; this refrain galled him. “They have credited David
with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands.
What more can he get but the kingdom?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7686">9</sup> And from that time on Saul kept a jealous
eye on David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7687">10</sup> The
next day an evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7687b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> spirit from God came
forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David
was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his
hand <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7688">11</sup> and he
hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But
David eluded him twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7689">12</sup> Saul
was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left
Saul. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7690">13</sup> So he
sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men,
and David led the troops in their campaigns. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7691">14</sup> In everything he did he had great
success,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7691c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> because the LORD was with him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7692">15</sup> When Saul saw
how successful<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7692d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> he was, he was afraid of
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7693">16</sup> But all
Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their
campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7694">17</sup> Saul
said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to
you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the
LORD.” For Saul said to himself, “I will not raise a hand against
him. Let the Philistines do that!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7695">18</sup> But
David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my father’s
clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7696">19</sup> So<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7696e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> when the time came for Merab,
Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to
Adriel of Meholah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7697">20</sup> Now
Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told
Saul about it, he was pleased. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7698">21</sup> “I will give her to him,” he thought,
“so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the
Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you
have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7699">22</sup> Then
Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say,
‘Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like
you; now become his son-in-law.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7700">23</sup> They
repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is
a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man
and little known.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7701">24</sup> When
Saul’s servants told him what David had said, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7702">25</sup> Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The
king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine
foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’” Saul’s plan was to
have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7703">26</sup> When
the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become
the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7704">27</sup> David and his
men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their
foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he
might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter
Michal in marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7705">28</sup> When
Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter
Michal loved David, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7706">29</sup> Saul became still more afraid of him,
and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7707">30</sup> The
Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often
as they did, David met with more success<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7707f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> than the rest of Saul’s officers,
and his name became well known.</p>
