<h4>Ezra 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Decree of Darius</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12153">1</sup> King
Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives
stored in the treasury at Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12154">2</sup> A scroll was found in the citadel of
Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorandum:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12155">3</sup> In the
first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the
temple of God in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to
present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be
ninety feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12155a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> high and ninety feet wide,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12156">4</sup> with three
courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be
paid by the royal treasury. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12157">5</sup> Also, the gold and silver articles of
the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in
Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their
places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the
house of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12158">6</sup> Now
then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai
and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from
there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12159">7</sup> Do not
interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of
the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its
site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12160">8</sup>
Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of
the Jews in the construction of this house of God:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenses of these men are to be fully paid
out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so
that the work will not stop. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12161">9</sup> Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams,
male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat,
salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must
be given them daily without fail, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12162">10</sup> so that they may offer sacrifices
pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the
king and his sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12163">11</sup>
Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is
to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled
on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12164">12</sup> May God, who
has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people
who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried
out with diligence.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Completion and Dedication of the
Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12165">13</sup> Then,
because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of
Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried
it out with diligence. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12166">14</sup> So the elders of the Jews continued to
build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and
Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple
according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of
Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12167">15</sup> The temple was completed
on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign
of King Darius.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12168">16</sup> Then
the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the
exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12169">17</sup> For the
dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two
hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for
all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12170">18</sup> And
they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in
their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what
is written in the Book of Moses.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Passover</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12171">19</sup> On the
fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the
Passover. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12172">20</sup> The
priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all
ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for
all the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12173">21</sup> So the
Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with
all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of
their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD, the God of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12174">22</sup> For
seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude
of the king of Assyria, so that he assisted them in the work on the
house of God, the God of Israel.
