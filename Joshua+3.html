<h4>Joshua 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Crossing the Jordan</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5895">1</sup> Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5896">2</sup> After three days the officers went throughout the camp, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5897">3</sup> giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5898">4</sup> Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5898a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> between you and the ark; do not go near it.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5899">5</sup> Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5900">6</sup> Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5901">7</sup> And the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5902">8</sup> Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan’s waters, go and stand in the river.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5903">9</sup> Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5904">10</sup> This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5905">11</sup> See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5906">12</sup> Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5907">13</sup> And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth—set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5908">14</sup> So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5909">15</sup> Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5910">16</sup> the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5910b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5911">17</sup> The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-5898a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-5898" title="Ir a Joshua 3:4">Joshua 3:4</a> Hebrew <i>about two thousand cubits</i> (about 900 meters)</li>
