<h4>Isaiah 46</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Gods of Babylon</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18588">1</sup> Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their idols are borne by beasts of burden.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18588a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <br />The images that are carried about are burdensome, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a burden for the weary. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18589">2</sup> They stoop and bow down together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unable to rescue the burden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they themselves go off into captivity. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18590">3</sup> “Listen to me, O house of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all you who remain of the house of Israel, <br />you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have carried since your birth. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18591">4</sup> Even to your old age and gray hairs <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am he, I am he who will sustain you. <br />I have made you and I will carry you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sustain you and I will rescue you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18592">5</sup> “To whom will you compare me or count me equal? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom will you liken me that we may be compared? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18593">6</sup> Some pour out gold from their bags <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and weigh out silver on the scales; <br />they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they bow down and worship it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18594">7</sup> They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they set it up in its place, and there it stands. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that spot it cannot move. <br />Though one cries out to it, it does not answer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it cannot save him from his troubles. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18595">8</sup> “Remember this, fix it in mind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take it to heart, you rebels. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18596">9</sup> Remember the former things, those of long ago; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am God, and there is no other; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am God, and there is none like me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18597">10</sup> I make known the end from the beginning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from ancient times, what is still to come. <br />I say: My purpose will stand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will do all that I please. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18598">11</sup> From the east I summon a bird of prey; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. <br />What I have said, that will I bring about; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I have planned, that will I do. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18599">12</sup> Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who are far from righteousness. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18600">13</sup> I am bringing my righteousness near, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not far away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my salvation will not be delayed. <br />I will grant salvation to Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my splendor to Israel. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18588a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18588" title="Ir a Isaiah 46:1">Isaiah 46:1</a> Or <i>are but beasts and cattle</i></li>
