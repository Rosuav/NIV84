<h5 class="passage-header">Daniel’s Vision of a Man</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22017">1</sup> In the
third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to
Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it
concerned a great war.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22017a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> The
understanding of the message came to him in a vision.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22018">2</sup> At
that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-22019">3</sup> I ate no choice food; no meat or wine
touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks
were over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22020">4</sup> On the
twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank
of the great river, the Tigris, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22021">5</sup> I looked up and there before me was a
man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his
waist. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22022">6</sup> His body
was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming
torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and
his voice like the sound of a multitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22023">7</sup> I,
Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did
not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid
themselves. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22024">8</sup> So
I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength
left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22025">9</sup> Then I heard him speaking,
and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the
ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22026">10</sup> A
hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22027">11</sup> He said,
“Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words
I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent
to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22028">12</sup> Then
he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that
you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself
before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response
to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22029">13</sup> But
the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then
Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was
detained there with the king of Persia. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22030">14</sup> Now I have come to explain to you what
will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a
time yet to come.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22031">15</sup> While
he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground
and was speechless. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22032">16</sup> Then one who looked like a
man<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22032b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> touched my lips, and I opened my
mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, “I
am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I am
helpless. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22033">17</sup> How
can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone
and I can hardly breathe.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22034">18</sup> Again
the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22035">19</sup> “Do not be
afraid, O man highly esteemed,” he said. “Peace! Be strong now; be
strong.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and
said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22036">20</sup> So he
said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to
fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of
Greece will come; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22037">21</sup> but first I will tell you what is
written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them
except Michael, your prince.</p>
