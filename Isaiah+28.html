<h4>Isaiah 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Woe to Ephraim</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18166">1</sup> Woe to
that wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the fading flower, his glorious beauty,<br>
set on the head of a fertile valley—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to that city, the pride of those laid low by
wine!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18167">2</sup> See, the Lord
has one who is powerful and strong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind,<br>
like a driving rain and a flooding downpour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will throw it forcefully to the ground.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18168">3</sup> That wreath,
the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be trampled underfoot.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18169">4</sup> That fading
flower, his glorious beauty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set on the head of a fertile valley,<br>
will be like a fig ripe before harvest—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his
hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he swallows it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18170">5</sup> In
that day the LORD Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be a glorious crown,<br>
a beautiful wreath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the remnant of his people.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18171">6</sup> He will be a
spirit of justice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to him who sits in judgment,<br>
a source of strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who turn back the battle at the
gate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18172">7</sup> And
these also stagger from wine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reel from beer:<br>
Priests and prophets stagger from beer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are befuddled with wine;<br>
they reel from beer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they stagger when seeing visions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they stumble when rendering decisions.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18173">8</sup> All the tables
are covered with vomit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is not a spot without filth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18174">9</sup> “Who
is it he is trying to teach?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom is he explaining his message?<br>
To children weaned from their milk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those just taken from the breast?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18175">10</sup> For it is:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do and do, do and do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule on rule, rule on rule<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18175a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little here, a little there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18176">11</sup> Very
well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will speak to this people,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18177">12</sup> to whom he
said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the resting place, let the weary
rest”;<br>
and, “This is the place of repose”—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they would not listen.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18178">13</sup> So then, the
word of the LORD to them will become:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do and do, do and do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule on rule, rule on rule;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little here, a little there—<br>
so that they will go and fall backward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be injured and snared and captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18179">14</sup>
Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who rule this people in Jerusalem.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18180">15</sup> You boast, “We
have entered into a covenant with death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18180b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> we
have made an agreement.<br>
When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it cannot touch us,<br>
for we have made a lie our refuge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and falsehood<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18180c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> our
hiding place.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18181">16</sup> So
this is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, I lay a stone in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tested stone,<br>
a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one who trusts will never be dismayed.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18182">17</sup> I will make
justice the measuring line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and righteousness the plumb line;<br>
hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and water will overflow your hiding place.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18183">18</sup> Your covenant
with death will be annulled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your agreement with the grave will not stand.<br>
When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be beaten down by it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18184">19</sup> As often as it
comes it will carry you away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morning after morning, by day and by night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will sweep through.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of this message<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will bring sheer terror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18185">20</sup> The bed is too
short to stretch out on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18186">21</sup> The LORD will
rise up as he did at Mount Perazim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will rouse himself as in the Valley of
Gibeon—<br>
to do his work, his strange work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perform his task, his alien task.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18187">22</sup> Now stop your
mocking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or your chains will become heavier;<br>
the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the destruction decreed against the whole
land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18188">23</sup>
Listen and hear my voice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay attention and hear what I say.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18189">24</sup> When a farmer
plows for planting, does he plow continually?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the
soil?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18190">25</sup> When he has
leveled the surface,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin?<br>
Does he not plant wheat in its place,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18190d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barley in its plot,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18190e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spelt in its field?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18191">26</sup> His God
instructs him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and teaches him the right way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18192">27</sup>
Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin;<br>
caraway is beaten out with a rod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cummin with a stick.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18193">28</sup> Grain must be
ground to make bread;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so one does not go on threshing it forever.<br>
Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his horses do not grind it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18194">29</sup> All this also
comes from the LORD Almighty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonderful in counsel and magnificent in
wisdom.</p>
