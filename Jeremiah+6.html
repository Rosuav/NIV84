<h4>Jeremiah 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jerusalem Under Siege</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19091">1</sup> “Flee for
safety, people of Benjamin!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flee from Jerusalem!<br>
Sound the trumpet in Tekoa!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem!<br>
For disaster looms out of the north,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even terrible destruction.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19092">2</sup> I will destroy
the Daughter of Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so beautiful and delicate.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19093">3</sup> Shepherds with
their flocks will come against her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will pitch their tents around her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each tending his own portion.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19094">4</sup>
“Prepare for battle against her!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, let us attack at noon!<br>
But, alas, the daylight is fading,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the shadows of evening grow long.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19095">5</sup> So arise, let
us attack at night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy her fortresses!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19096">6</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cut down the trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and build siege ramps against Jerusalem.<br>
This city must be punished;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is filled with oppression.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19097">7</sup> As a well pours
out its water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so she pours out her wickedness.<br>
Violence and destruction resound in her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her sickness and wounds are ever before me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19098">8</sup> Take warning, O
Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or I will turn away from you<br>
and make your land desolate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so no one can live in it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19099">9</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let them glean the remnant of Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as thoroughly as a vine;<br>
pass your hand over the branches again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like one gathering grapes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19100">10</sup> To
whom can I speak and give warning?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will listen to me?<br>
Their ears are closed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19100a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they cannot hear.<br>
The word of the LORD is offensive to them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they find no pleasure in it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19101">11</sup> But I am full
of the wrath of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I cannot hold it in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pour it out on the children in the street<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the young men gathered together;<br>
both husband and wife will be caught in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the old, those weighed down with years.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19102">12</sup> Their houses
will be turned over to others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together with their fields and their wives,<br>
when I stretch out my hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against those who live in the land,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19103">13</sup> “From the
least to the greatest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all are greedy for gain;<br>
prophets and priests alike,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all practice deceit.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19104">14</sup> They dress the
wound of my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as though it were not serious.<br>
‘Peace, peace,’ they say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when there is no peace.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19105">15</sup> Are they
ashamed of their loathsome conduct?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they have no shame at all;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not even know how to blush.<br>
So they will fall among the fallen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be brought down when I punish
them,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19106">16</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Stand at the crossroads and look;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask for the ancient paths,<br>
ask where the good way is, and walk in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will find rest for your souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19107">17</sup> I appointed
watchmen over you and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said, ‘We will not listen.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19108">18</sup> Therefore
hear, O nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observe, O witnesses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what will happen to them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19109">19</sup> Hear, O
earth:<br>
I am bringing disaster on this people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fruit of their schemes,<br>
because they have not listened to my words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have rejected my law.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19110">20</sup> What do I care
about incense from Sheba<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or sweet calamus from a distant land?<br>
Your burnt offerings are not acceptable;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your sacrifices do not please me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19111">21</sup>
Therefore this is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will put obstacles before this people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fathers and sons alike will stumble over
them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors and friends will perish.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19112">22</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Look, an army is coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the land of the north;<br>
a great nation is being stirred up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the ends of the earth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19113">23</sup> They are armed
with bow and spear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are cruel and show no mercy.<br>
They sound like the roaring sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they ride on their horses;<br>
they come like men in battle formation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to attack you, O Daughter of Zion.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19114">24</sup> We
have heard reports about them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and our hands hang limp.<br>
Anguish has gripped us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain like that of a woman in labor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19115">25</sup> Do not go out
to the fields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or walk on the roads,<br>
for the enemy has a sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is terror on every side.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19116">26</sup> O my people,
put on sackcloth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and roll in ashes;<br>
mourn with bitter wailing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as for an only son,<br>
for suddenly the destroyer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come upon us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19117">27</sup> “I
have made you a tester of metals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my people the ore,<br>
that you may observe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and test their ways.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19118">28</sup> They are all
hardened rebels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going about to slander.<br>
They are bronze and iron;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all act corruptly.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19119">29</sup> The bellows
blow fiercely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to burn away the lead with fire,<br>
but the refining goes on in vain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wicked are not purged out.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19120">30</sup> They are
called rejected silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the LORD has rejected them.”</p>
