<p><h4>Isaiah 55</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Invitation to the Thirsty</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18742">1</sup> “Come, all you who are thirsty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to the waters; <br />and you who have no money, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, buy and eat! <br />Come, buy wine and milk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without money and without cost. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18743">2</sup> Why spend money on what is not bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your labor on what does not satisfy? <br />Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your soul will delight in the richest of fare. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18744">3</sup> Give ear and come to me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear me, that your soul may live. <br />I will make an everlasting covenant with you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my faithful love promised to David. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18745">4</sup> See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a leader and commander of the peoples. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18746">5</sup> Surely you will summon nations you know not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nations that do not know you will hasten to you, <br />because of the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has endowed you with splendor.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18747">6</sup> Seek the LORD while he may be found; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call on him while he is near. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18748">7</sup> Let the wicked forsake his way <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the evil man his thoughts. <br />Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to our God, for he will freely pardon. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18749">8</sup> “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither are your ways my ways,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18750">9</sup> “As the heavens are higher than the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so are my ways higher than your ways <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my thoughts than your thoughts. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18751">10</sup> As the rain and the snow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come down from heaven, <br />and do not return to it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without watering the earth <br />and making it bud and flourish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18752">11</sup> so is my word that goes out from my mouth: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not return to me empty, <br />but will accomplish what I desire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18753">12</sup> You will go out in joy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be led forth in peace; <br />the mountains and hills <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will burst into song before you, <br />and all the trees of the field <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will clap their hands. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18754">13</sup> Instead of the thornbush will grow the pine tree, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and instead of briers the myrtle will grow. <br />This will be for the LORD’s renown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an everlasting sign, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will not be destroyed.” </p></div></body></html>
