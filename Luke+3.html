<p><h4>Luke 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25019">1</sup> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25020">2</sup> during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25021">3</sup> He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25022">4</sup> As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A voice of one calling in the desert, <br />‘Prepare the way for the Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make straight paths for him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25023">5</sup> Every valley shall be filled in, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every mountain and hill made low. <br />The crooked roads shall become straight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rough ways smooth. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25024">6</sup> And all mankind will see God’s salvation.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25024a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25025">7</sup> John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25026">8</sup> Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25027">9</sup> The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25028">10</sup> “What should we do then?” the crowd asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25029">11</sup> John answered, “The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25030">12</sup> Tax collectors also came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25031">13</sup> “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25032">14</sup> Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25033">15</sup> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25033b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25034">16</sup> John answered them all, “I baptize you with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25034c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25035">17</sup> His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25036">18</sup> And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25037">19</sup> But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25038">20</sup> Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison. <h5 class="passage-header">The Baptism and Genealogy of Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25039">21</sup> When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25040">22</sup> and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25041">23</sup> Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Heli, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25042">24</sup> the son of Matthat, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Levi, the son of Melki, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25043">25</sup> the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Naggai, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25044">26</sup> the son of Maath, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Josech, the son of Joda, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25045">27</sup> the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Neri, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25046">28</sup> the son of Melki, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25047">29</sup> the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Levi, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25048">30</sup> the son of Simeon, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25049">31</sup> the son of Melea, the son of Menna, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of David, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25050">32</sup> the son of Jesse, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Salmon,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25050d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the son of Nahshon, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25051">33</sup> the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25051e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Judah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25052">34</sup> the son of Jacob, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25053">35</sup> the son of Serug, the son of Reu, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Shelah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25054">36</sup> the son of Cainan, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25055">37</sup> the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Kenan, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25056">38</sup> the son of Enosh, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Seth, the son of Adam, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of God. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25024a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25024" title="Go to Luke 3:6">Luke 3:6</a> Isaiah 40:3-5</li>
