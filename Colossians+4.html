<h4>Colossians 4</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29528">1</sup>
Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because
you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Further Instructions</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29529">2</sup> Devote
yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29530">3</sup> And pray for us, too, that
God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the
mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29531">4</sup> Pray that I may proclaim it clearly,
as I should. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29532">5</sup> Be
wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every
opportunity. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29533">6</sup>
Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt,
so that you may know how to answer everyone.
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29534">7</sup> Tychicus
will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a
faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29535">8</sup> I am sending him to you
for the express purpose that you may know about our<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29535a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> circumstances and that he may
encourage your hearts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29536">9</sup> He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful
and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything
that is happening here.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29537">10</sup> My
fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark,
the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him;
if he comes to you, welcome him.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29538">11</sup> Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends
greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the
kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29539">12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of
you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always
wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the
will of God, mature and fully assured. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29540">13</sup> I vouch for him that he is working hard
for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29541">14</sup> Our dear friend Luke, the
doctor, and Demas send greetings. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29542">15</sup> Give my greetings to the brothers at
Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29543">16</sup> After
this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the
church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from
Laodicea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29544">17</sup> Tell
Archippus: “See to it that you complete the work you have received
in the Lord.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29545">18</sup> I,
Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace
be with you.</p>
