<h4>2 Samuel 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">David Anointed King Over Judah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8051">1</sup> In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. “Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” he asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD said, “Go up.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David asked, “Where shall I go?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To Hebron,” the LORD answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8052">2</sup> So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8053">3</sup> David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8054">4</sup> Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8055">5</sup> he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, “The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8056">6</sup> May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8057">7</sup> Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.” <h5 class="passage-header">War Between the Houses of David and Saul</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8058">8</sup> Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8059">9</sup> He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8059a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8060">10</sup> Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8061">11</sup> The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8062">12</sup> Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8063">13</sup> Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8064">14</sup> Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All right, let them do it,” Joab said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8065">15</sup> So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8066">16</sup> Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8066b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8067">17</sup> The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David’s men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8068">18</sup> The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8069">19</sup> He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8070">20</sup> Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is,” he answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8071">21</sup> Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8072">22</sup> Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8073">23</sup> But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8074">24</sup> But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8075">25</sup> Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8076">26</sup> Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8077">27</sup> Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8077c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8078">28</sup> So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8079">29</sup> All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8079d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and came to Mahanaim. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8080">30</sup> Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8081">31</sup> But David’s men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8082">32</sup> They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8059a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8059" title="Ir a 2 Samuel 2:9">2 Samuel 2:9</a> Or <i>Asher</i></li>
