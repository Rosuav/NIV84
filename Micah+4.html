<p><h4>Micah 4</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Mountain of the LORD</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22622">1</sup> In the last days <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as chief among the mountains; <br />it will be raised above the hills, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and peoples will stream to it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22623">2</sup> Many nations will come and say, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the house of the God of Jacob. <br />He will teach us his ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we may walk in his paths.” <br />The law will go out from Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22624">3</sup> He will judge between many peoples <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. <br />They will beat their swords into plowshares <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their spears into pruning hooks. <br />Nation will not take up sword against nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will they train for war anymore. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22625">4</sup> Every man will sit under his own vine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under his own fig tree, <br />and no one will make them afraid, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD Almighty has spoken. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22626">5</sup> All the nations may walk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the name of their gods; <br />we will walk in the name of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our God for ever and ever. <h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Plan</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22627">6</sup> “In that day,” declares the LORD, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will gather the lame; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will assemble the exiles <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those I have brought to grief. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22628">7</sup> I will make the lame a remnant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those driven away a strong nation. <br />The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from that day and forever. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22629">8</sup> As for you, O watchtower of the flock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O stronghold<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22629a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of the Daughter of Zion, <br />the former dominion will be restored to you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingship will come to the Daughter of Jerusalem.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22630">9</sup> Why do you now cry aloud— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have you no king? <br />Has your counselor perished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22631">10</sup> Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a woman in labor, <br />for now you must leave the city <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to camp in the open field. <br />You will go to Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there you will be rescued. <br />There the LORD will redeem you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the hand of your enemies. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22632">11</sup> But now many nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are gathered against you. <br />They say, “Let her be defiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let our eyes gloat over Zion!” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22633">12</sup> But they do not know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thoughts of the LORD; <br />they do not understand his plan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22634">13</sup> “Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I will give you horns of iron; <br />I will give you hoofs of bronze <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will break to pieces many nations.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their wealth to the Lord of all the earth. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22629a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22629" title="Go to Micah 4:8">Micah 4:8</a> Or <i>hill</i></li>
