<h4>Genesis 33</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob Meets Esau</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-962">1</sup> Jacob
looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so
he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two
maidservants. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-963">2</sup> He
put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her
children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-964">3</sup> He himself went on ahead and
bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-965">4</sup> But Esau
ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his
neck and kissed him. And they wept. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-966">5</sup> Then Esau looked up and saw the women and
children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob answered, “They are the children God has
graciously given your servant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-967">6</sup> Then the
maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-968">7</sup> Next, Leah and
her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and
Rachel, and they too bowed down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-969">8</sup> Esau
asked, “What do you mean by all these droves I met?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he
said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-970">9</sup> But Esau
said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for
yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-971">10</sup> “No,
please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept
this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of
God, now that you have received me favorably. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-972">11</sup> Please accept the present that was
brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I
need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-973">12</sup> Then
Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-974">13</sup> But
Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and
that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their
young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will
die. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-975">14</sup> So let my
lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the
pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come
to my lord in Seir.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-976">15</sup> Esau
said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me
find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-977">16</sup> So that
day Esau started on his way back to Seir. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-978">17</sup> Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he
built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That
is why the place is called Succoth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-978a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-979">18</sup> After
Jacob came from Paddan Aram,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-979b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> he
arrived safely at the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-979c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> city of
Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-980">19</sup> For a hundred pieces of
silver,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-980d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> he bought from the sons of Hamor,
the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his
tent. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-981">20</sup> There he
set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.<sup class=
