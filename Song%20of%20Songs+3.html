<h4>Song of Songs 3</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17573">1</sup> All night long on my bed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked for the one my heart loves; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked for him but did not find him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17574">2</sup> I will get up now and go about the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through its streets and squares; <br />I will search for the one my heart loves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I looked for him but did not find him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17575">3</sup> The watchmen found me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they made their rounds in the city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have you seen the one my heart loves?” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17576">4</sup> Scarcely had I passed them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I found the one my heart loves. <br />I held him and would not let him go <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till I had brought him to my mother’s house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the room of the one who conceived me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17577">5</sup> Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the gazelles and by the does of the field: <br />Do not arouse or awaken love <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until it so desires. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17578">6</sup> Who is this coming up from the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a column of smoke, <br />perfumed with myrrh and incense <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made from all the spices of the merchant? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17579">7</sup> Look! It is Solomon’s carriage, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escorted by sixty warriors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the noblest of Israel, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17580">8</sup> all of them wearing the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all experienced in battle, <br />each with his sword at his side, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared for the terrors of the night. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17581">9</sup> King Solomon made for himself the carriage; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he made it of wood from Lebanon. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17582">10</sup> Its posts he made of silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its base of gold. <br />Its seat was upholstered with purple, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its interior lovingly inlaid <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17582a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> the daughters of Jerusalem. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17583">11</sup> Come out, you daughters of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and look at King Solomon wearing the crown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the crown with which his mother crowned him <br />on the day of his wedding, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day his heart rejoiced. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-17582a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-17582" title="Ir a Song of Songs 3:10">Song of Songs 3:10</a> Or <i>its inlaid interior a gift of love / from</i></li>
