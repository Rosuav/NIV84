<h4>John 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Lazarus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26514">1</sup> Now a man
named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary
and her sister Martha. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26515">2</sup> This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay
sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his
feet with her hair. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26516">3</sup> So the sisters sent word to Jesus,
“Lord, the one you love is sick.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26517">4</sup> When
he heard this, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“This sickness will
not end in death. No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may
be glorified through it.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26518">5</sup> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26519">6</sup> Yet
when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two
more days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26520">7</sup> Then
he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“Let us go back to
Judea.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26521">8</sup> “But
Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you,
and yet you are going back there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26522">9</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“Are there not twelve hours of
daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by
this world’s light.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26523">10</sup> It is when he walks by night that he
stumbles, for he has no light.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26524">11</sup> After
he had said this, he went on to tell them, <font class='woj'>“Our
friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him
up.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26525">12</sup> His
disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26526">13</sup> Jesus had been
speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural
sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26527">14</sup> So
then he told them plainly, <font class='woj'>“Lazarus is
dead,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26528">15</sup> and for your sake I am glad I was not
there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26529">16</sup> Then
Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us
also go, that we may die with him.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Comforts the Sisters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26530">17</sup> On his
arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for
four days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26531">18</sup>
Bethany was less than two miles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26531a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> from
Jerusalem, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26532">19</sup> and
many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss
of their brother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26533">20</sup> When Martha heard that Jesus was
coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26534">21</sup>
“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother
would not have died. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26535">22</sup> But I know that even now God will give
you whatever you ask.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26536">23</sup> Jesus
said to her, <font class='woj'>“Your brother will rise
again.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26537">24</sup>
Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at
the last day.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26538">25</sup> Jesus
said to her, <font class='woj'>“I am the resurrection and the life.
He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26539">26</sup> and whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26540">27</sup> “Yes,
Lord,” she told him, “I believe that you are the Christ,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26540b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the Son of God, who was to come into
the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26541">28</sup> And
after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary
aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26542">29</sup> When Mary
heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26543">30</sup> Now Jesus had not yet
entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had
met him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26544">31</sup> When
the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her,
noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her,
supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26545">32</sup> When
Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his
feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not
have died.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26546">33</sup> When
Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her
also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26547">34</sup> “Where have you laid him?”</font> he
asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come and see, Lord,” they replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26548">35</sup> Jesus
wept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26549">36</sup> Then
the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26550">37</sup> But
some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind
man have kept this man from dying?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Raises Lazarus From the Dead</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26551">38</sup> Jesus,
once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a
stone laid across the entrance. <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26552">39</sup> “Take away the
stone,”</font> he said.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the
dead man, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there
four days.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26553">40</sup> Then
Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Did I not tell you that if you
believed, you would see the glory of God?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26554">41</sup> So
they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said,
<font class='woj'>“Father, I thank you that you have heard
me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26555">42</sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I
said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they
may believe that you sent me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26556">43</sup> When
he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, <font class=
'woj'>“Lazarus, come out!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26557">44</sup> The dead man came out, his hands and
feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Take
off the grave clothes and let him go.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plot to Kill Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26558">45</sup>
Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen
what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26559">46</sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees
and told them what Jesus had done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26560">47</sup> Then the chief priests and the
Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here
is this man performing many miraculous signs. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26561">48</sup> If we let him go on like this,
everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and
take away both our place<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26561c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and our
nation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26562">49</sup> Then
one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke
up, “You know nothing at all! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26563">50</sup> You do not realize that it is better
for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation
perish.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26564">51</sup> He
did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he
prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26565">52</sup> and not only for that
nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them
together and make them one. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26566">53</sup> So from that day on they plotted to
take his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26567">54</sup>
Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews.
Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village
called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26568">55</sup> When
it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the
country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the
Passover. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26569">56</sup> They
kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they
asked one another, “What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the Feast
at all?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26570">57</sup> But
the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone
found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might
arrest him.</p>
