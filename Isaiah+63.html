<p><h4>Isaiah 63</h4><h5 class="passage-header">God’s Day of Vengeance and Redemption</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18868">1</sup> Who is this coming from Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? <br />Who is this, robed in splendor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;striding forward in the greatness of his strength? <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is I, speaking in righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mighty to save.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18869">2</sup> Why are your garments red, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like those of one treading the winepress? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18870">3</sup> “I have trodden the winepress alone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the nations no one was with me. <br />I trampled them in my anger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and trod them down in my wrath; <br />their blood spattered my garments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I stained all my clothing. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18871">4</sup> For the day of vengeance was in my heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the year of my redemption has come. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18872">5</sup> I looked, but there was no one to help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was appalled that no one gave support; <br />so my own arm worked salvation for me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my own wrath sustained me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18873">6</sup> I trampled the nations in my anger; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my wrath I made them drunk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and poured their blood on the ground.” <h5 class="passage-header">Praise and Prayer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18874">7</sup> I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deeds for which he is to be praised, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to all the LORD has done for us— <br />yes, the many good things he has done <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the house of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to his compassion and many kindnesses. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18875">8</sup> He said, “Surely they are my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons who will not be false to me”; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so he became their Savior. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18876">9</sup> In all their distress he too was distressed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the angel of his presence saved them. <br />In his love and mercy he redeemed them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he lifted them up and carried them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of old. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18877">10</sup> Yet they rebelled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grieved his Holy Spirit. <br />So he turned and became their enemy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he himself fought against them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18878">11</sup> Then his people recalled<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18878a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the days of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the days of Moses and his people— <br />where is he who brought them through the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the shepherd of his flock? <br />Where is he who set <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Holy Spirit among them, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18879">12</sup> who sent his glorious arm of power <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be at Moses’ right hand, <br />who divided the waters before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to gain for himself everlasting renown, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18880">13</sup> who led them through the depths? <br />Like a horse in open country, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they did not stumble; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18881">14</sup> like cattle that go down to the plain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. <br />This is how you guided your people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make for yourself a glorious name. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18882">15</sup> Look down from heaven and see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. <br />Where are your zeal and your might? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18883">16</sup> But you are our Father, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though Abraham does not know us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or Israel acknowledge us; <br />you, O LORD, are our Father, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our Redeemer from of old is your name. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18884">17</sup> Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? <br />Return for the sake of your servants, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tribes that are your inheritance. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18885">18</sup> For a little while your people possessed your holy place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18886">19</sup> We are yours from of old; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you have not ruled over them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have not been called by your name.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18886b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18878a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18878" title="Go to Isaiah 63:11">Isaiah 63:11</a> Or <i>But may he recall</i></li>
