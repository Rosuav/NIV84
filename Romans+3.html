<h4>Romans 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Faithfulness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27978">1</sup> What
advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in
circumcision? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27979">2</sup>
Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the
very words of God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27980">3</sup> What
if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s
faithfulness? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27981">4</sup>
Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is
written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So that you may be proved right when you
speak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prevail when you judge.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27981a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27982">5</sup> But if
our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly,
what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us?
(I am using a human argument.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27983">6</sup> Certainly not! If that were so, how
could God judge the world? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27984">7</sup> Someone might argue, “If my falsehood
enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I
still condemned as a sinner?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27985">8</sup> Why not say—as we are being slanderously
reported as saying and as some claim that we say—“Let us do evil
that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">No One Is Righteous</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27986">9</sup> What
shall we conclude then? Are we any better<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27986b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>? Not at all! We have already made the
charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27987">10</sup> As it is written:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is no one righteous, not even one;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27988">11</sup> there is
no one who understands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one who seeks God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27989">12</sup> All have
turned away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have together become worthless;<br>
there is no one who does good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not even one.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27989c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27990">13</sup> “Their throats
are open graves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their tongues practice deceit.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27990d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup><br>
“The poison of vipers is on their lips.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27990e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27991">14</sup> “Their
mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27991f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27992">15</sup> “Their feet
are swift to shed blood;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27993">16</sup> ruin and
misery mark their ways,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27994">17</sup> and the way of
peace they do not know.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27994g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27995">18</sup> “There
is no fear of God before their eyes.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27995h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27996">19</sup> Now
we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under
the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world
held accountable to God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27997">20</sup> Therefore no one will be declared
righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the
law we become conscious of sin.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Righteousness Through Faith</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27998">21</sup> But now
a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to
which the Law and the Prophets testify. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27999">22</sup> This righteousness from God comes
through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no
difference, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28000">23</sup>
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28001">24</sup> and are justified freely
by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28002">25</sup> God presented
him as a sacrifice of atonement,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28002i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> through
faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because
in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand
unpunished— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28003">26</sup> he
did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be
just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28004">27</sup>
Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On
that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28005">28</sup> For we maintain that a
man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28006">29</sup> Is God the God of Jews
only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28007">30</sup> since there is
only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the
uncircumcised through that same faith. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28008">31</sup> Do we, then, nullify the law by this
faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</p>
