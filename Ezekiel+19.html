<p><h4>Ezekiel 19</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Lament for Israel’s Princes</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20883">1</sup> “Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20884">2</sup> and say: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘What a lioness was your mother <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the lions! <br />She lay down among the young lions <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reared her cubs. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20885">3</sup> She brought up one of her cubs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he became a strong lion. <br />He learned to tear the prey <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he devoured men. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20886">4</sup> The nations heard about him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was trapped in their pit. <br />They led him with hooks <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the land of Egypt. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20887">5</sup> “‘When she saw her hope unfulfilled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her expectation gone, <br />she took another of her cubs <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made him a strong lion. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20888">6</sup> He prowled among the lions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he was now a strong lion. <br />He learned to tear the prey <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he devoured men. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20889">7</sup> He broke down<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20889a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> their strongholds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and devastated their towns. <br />The land and all who were in it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were terrified by his roaring. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20890">8</sup> Then the nations came against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those from regions round about. <br />They spread their net for him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was trapped in their pit. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20891">9</sup> With hooks they pulled him into a cage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brought him to the king of Babylon. <br />They put him in prison, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so his roar was heard no longer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the mountains of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20892">10</sup> “‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20892b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted by the water; <br />it was fruitful and full of branches <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of abundant water. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20893">11</sup> Its branches were strong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fit for a ruler’s scepter. <br />It towered high <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above the thick foliage, <br />conspicuous for its height <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for its many branches. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20894">12</sup> But it was uprooted in fury <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thrown to the ground. <br />The east wind made it shrivel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was stripped of its fruit; <br />its strong branches withered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire consumed them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20895">13</sup> Now it is planted in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dry and thirsty land. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20896">14</sup> Fire spread from one of its main<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20896c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> branches <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and consumed its fruit. <br />No strong branch is left on it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fit for a ruler’s scepter.’ <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20889a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20889" title="Go to Ezekiel 19:7">Ezekiel 19:7</a> Targum (see Septuagint); Hebrew <i>He knew</i></li>
