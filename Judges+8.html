<h3>Judges 8</h3>

<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6721" class="text Judg-8-1">Zebah and
Zalmunna</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-8-1"><span class=
"chapternum">8&nbsp;</span>Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, “Why
have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you call us when you went
to fight Midian? ” And they criticized him sharply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6722" class="text Judg-8-2"><sup class=
"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>But he answered them, “What have I
accomplished compared to you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim’s
grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6723" class="text Judg-8-3"><sup class=
"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite
leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?”
At this, their resentment against him subsided.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6724" class="text Judg-8-4"><sup class=
"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted
yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed
it.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6725" class=
"text Judg-8-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>He said to the
men of Succoth, “Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and
I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of
Midian.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6726" class="text Judg-8-6"><sup class=
"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>But the officials of Succoth said, “Do you
already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession?
Why should we give bread to your troops?” </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6727" class="text Judg-8-7"><sup class=
"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then Gideon replied, “Just for that, when
the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand,
I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6728" class="text Judg-8-8"><sup class=
"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>From there he went up to Peniel<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6728a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and made the same request of them,
but they answered as the men of Succoth had.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6729" class="text Judg-8-9"><sup class=
"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>So he said to the men of Peniel, “When I
return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.” </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6730" class="text Judg-8-10"><sup class=
"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with
a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the
armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand
swordsmen had fallen.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6731" class=
"text Judg-8-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Gideon went up
by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon
the unsuspecting army.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6732" class=
"text Judg-8-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Zebah and
Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and
captured them, routing their entire army.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6733" class="text Judg-8-13"><sup class=
"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Gideon son of Joash then returned from the
battle by the Pass of Heres.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6734"
class="text Judg-8-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>He
caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man
wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of
Succoth, the elders of the town.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6735"
class="text Judg-8-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Then
Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, “Here are Zebah and
Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, ‘Do you already have
the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we
give bread to your exhausted men? ’”</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6736" class="text Judg-8-16"><sup class=
"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>He took the elders of the town and taught
the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns
and briers.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6737" class=
"text Judg-8-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>He also pulled
down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.
</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6738" class="text Judg-8-18"><sup class=
"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What
kind of men did you kill at Tabor? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-8-18">“Men like you,” they answered,
“each one with the bearing of a prince.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6739" class="text Judg-8-19"><sup class=
"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers,
the sons of my own mother. As surely as the <span style=
"font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, if
you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.”</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6740" class="text Judg-8-20"><sup class=
"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he
said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, because he
was only a boy and was afraid.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6741" class="text Judg-8-21"><sup class=
"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come, do it
yourself. ‘As is the man, so is his strength.’” So Gideon stepped
forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels’
necks.</span></p>
<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6742" class="text Judg-8-22">Gideon’s
Ephod</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-8-22"><sup class=
"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over
us—you, your son and your grandson—because you have saved us out of
the hand of Midian.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6743" class="text Judg-8-23"><sup class=
"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>But Gideon told them, “I will not rule
over you, nor will my son rule over you. The <span style=
"font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will rule
over you.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6744" class=
"text Judg-8-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>And he said,
“I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from
your share of the plunder. ” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites
to wear gold earrings.)</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6745" class="text Judg-8-25"><sup class=
"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>They answered, “We’ll be glad to give
them.” So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from
his plunder onto it.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6746" class=
"text Judg-8-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>The weight of
the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred
shekels,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6746b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> not counting the ornaments, the
pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the
chains that were on their camels’ necks.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6747" class="text Judg-8-27"><sup class=
"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which
he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by
worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his
family. </span></p>
<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6748" class="text Judg-8-28">Gideon’s
Death</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-8-28"><sup class=
"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Thus Midian was subdued before the
Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s
lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6749" class="text Judg-8-29"><sup class=
"versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to
live.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6750" class=
"text Judg-8-30"><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>He had seventy
sons of his own, for he had many wives.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6751" class="text Judg-8-31"><sup class=
"versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also
bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6752" class="text Judg-8-32"><sup class=
"versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age
and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6753" class="text Judg-8-33"><sup class=
"versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>No sooner had Gideon died than the
Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up
Baal-Berith as their god</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6754" class=
"text Judg-8-34"><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>and did not
remember the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> their God, who had rescued them from the
hands of all their enemies on every side.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6755" class="text Judg-8-35"><sup class=
"versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>They also failed to show kindness to the
family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he
had done for them. </span></p>
