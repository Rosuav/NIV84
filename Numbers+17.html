<h4>Numbers 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Budding of Aaron’s Staff</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4246">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4247">2</sup>
“Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from
the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of
each man on his staff. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4248">3</sup> On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name,
for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4249">4</sup> Place them in
the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4250">5</sup> The staff
belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of
this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4251">6</sup> So
Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve
staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and
Aaron’s staff was among them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4252">7</sup> Moses placed the staffs before the LORD
in the Tent of the Testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4253">8</sup> The
next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that
Aaron’s staff, which represented the house of Levi, had not only
sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4254">9</sup> Then Moses
brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the
Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own
staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4255">10</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the
Testimony, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an
end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4256">11</sup> Moses did just
as the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4257">12</sup> The
Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all
lost! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4258">13</sup> Anyone
who even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all
going to die?”</p>
