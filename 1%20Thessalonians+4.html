<h4>1 Thessalonians 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Living to Please God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29589">1</sup> Finally,
brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as
in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord
Jesus to do this more and more. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29590">2</sup> For you know what instructions we gave
you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29591">3</sup> It is
God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid
sexual immorality; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29592">4</sup> that each of you should learn to control
his own body<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29592a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in a way that is holy and
honorable, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29593">5</sup> not
in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29594">6</sup> and that in
this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of
him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already
told you and warned you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29595">7</sup> For God did not call us to be impure,
but to live a holy life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29596">8</sup> Therefore, he who rejects this
instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29597">9</sup> Now
about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you
yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29598">10</sup> And in fact, you do love
all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers,
to do so more and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29599">11</sup> Make
it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business
and to work with your hands, just as we told you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29600">12</sup> so that your daily life
may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be
dependent on anybody.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Coming of the Lord</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29601">13</sup>
Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall
asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29602">14</sup> We believe
that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will
bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29603">15</sup> According to the Lord’s
own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left
till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who
have fallen asleep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29604">16</sup> For the Lord himself will come down
from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel
and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise
first. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29605">17</sup> After
that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
so we will be with the Lord forever. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29606">18</sup> Therefore encourage each other with
these words.
