<h4>Jeremiah 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah’s Complaint</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19251">1</sup> You are
always righteous, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I bring a case before you.<br>
Yet I would speak with you about your justice:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the way of the wicked prosper?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do all the faithless live at ease?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19252">2</sup> You have
planted them, and they have taken root;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they grow and bear fruit.<br>
You are always on their lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but far from their hearts.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19253">3</sup> Yet you know
me, O LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you see me and test my thoughts about you.<br>
Drag them off like sheep to be butchered!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set them apart for the day of slaughter!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19254">4</sup> How long will
the land lie parched<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19254a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the grass in every field be withered?<br>
Because those who live in it are wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the animals and birds have perished.<br>
Moreover, the people are saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He will not see what happens to us.”
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Answer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19255">5</sup> “If you
have raced with men on foot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they have worn you out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how can you compete with horses?<br>
If you stumble in safe country,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19255b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how will you manage in the thickets by<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19255c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the Jordan?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19256">6</sup> Your brothers,
your own family—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even they have betrayed you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have raised a loud cry against you.<br>
Do not trust them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though they speak well of you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19257">7</sup> “I
will forsake my house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abandon my inheritance;<br>
I will give the one I love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the hands of her enemies.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19258">8</sup> My inheritance
has become to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lion in the forest.<br>
She roars at me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I hate her.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19259">9</sup> Has not my
inheritance become to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a speckled bird of prey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that other birds of prey surround and attack?<br>
Go and gather all the wild beasts;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring them to devour.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19260">10</sup> Many shepherds
will ruin my vineyard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and trample down my field;<br>
they will turn my pleasant field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into a desolate wasteland.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19261">11</sup> It will be
made a wasteland,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parched and desolate before me;<br>
the whole land will be laid waste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because there is no one who cares.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19262">12</sup> Over all the
barren heights in the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroyers will swarm,<br>
for the sword of the LORD will devour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from one end of the land to the other;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will be safe.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19263">13</sup> They will sow
wheat but reap thorns;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will wear themselves out but gain
nothing.<br>
So bear the shame of your harvest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the LORD’s fierce anger.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19264">14</sup> This
is what the LORD says: “As for all my wicked neighbors who seize
the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from
their lands and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19265">15</sup> But after I
uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of
them back to his own inheritance and his own country. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19266">16</sup> And if they learn well
the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as
the LORD lives’—even as they once taught my people to swear by
Baal—then they will be established among my people. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19267">17</sup> But if any nation does
not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,” declares the
LORD.</p>
