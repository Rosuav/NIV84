<h4>Deuteronomy 22</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5472">1</sup> If you
see your brother’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be
sure to take it back to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5473">2</sup> If the brother does not live near you or
if you do not know who he is, take it home with you and keep it
until he comes looking for it. Then give it back to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5474">3</sup> Do the same if
you find your brother’s donkey or his cloak or anything he loses.
Do not ignore it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5475">4</sup> If you
see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen on the road, do not
ignore it. Help him get it to its feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5476">5</sup> A woman
must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for
the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5477">6</sup> If you
come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on
the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs,
do not take the mother with the young. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5478">7</sup> You may take the young, but be sure to
let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have
a long life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5479">8</sup> When
you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you
may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls
from the roof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5480">9</sup> Do not
plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the
crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be
defiled.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5480a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5481">10</sup> Do not
plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5482">11</sup> Do not
wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5483">12</sup> Make
tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Marriage Violations</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5484">13</sup> If a man
takes a wife and, after lying with her, dislikes her <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5485">14</sup> and slanders her and gives
her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I
approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5486">15</sup> then the girl’s father and
mother shall bring proof that she was a virgin to the town elders
at the gate. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5487">16</sup>
The girl’s father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in
marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5488">17</sup> Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I
did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof
of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the
cloth before the elders of the town, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5489">18</sup> and the elders shall take the man and
punish him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5490">19</sup>
They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5490b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and give them to the girl’s
father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name.
She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long
as he lives.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5491">20</sup> If,
however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl’s virginity
can be found, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5492">21</sup>
she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there
the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a
disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her
father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5493">22</sup> If a
man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who
slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from
Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5494">23</sup> If a
man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he
sleeps with her, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5495">24</sup> you shall take both of them to the gate
of that town and stone them to death—the girl because she was in a
town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated
another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5496">25</sup> But if
out in the country a man happens to meet a girl pledged to be
married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5497">26</sup> Do nothing to
the girl; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is
like that of someone who attacks and murders his neighbor,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5498">27</sup> for the man
found the girl out in the country, and though the betrothed girl
screamed, there was no one to rescue her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5499">28</sup> If a
man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and
rapes her and they are discovered, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5500">29</sup> he shall pay the girl’s father fifty
shekels of silver.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5500c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> He must
marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her
as long as he lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5501">30</sup> A man
is not to marry his father’s wife; he must not dishonor his
father’s bed.</p>
