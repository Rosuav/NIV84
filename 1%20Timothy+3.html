<h4>1 Timothy 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Overseers and Deacons</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29717">1</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29717a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> he desires a noble task. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29718">2</sup> Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29719">3</sup> not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29720">4</sup> He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29721">5</sup> (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29722">6</sup> He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29723">7</sup> He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29724">8</sup> Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29725">9</sup> They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29726">10</sup> They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29727">11</sup> In the same way, their wives<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29727b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29728">12</sup> A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29729">13</sup> Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29730">14</sup> Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29731">15</sup> if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29732">16</sup> Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29732c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> appeared in a body,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29732d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was vindicated by the Spirit, <br />was seen by angels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was preached among the nations, <br />was believed on in the world, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was taken up in glory. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29717a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29717" title="Ir a 1 Timothy 3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</a> Traditionally <i>bishop</i>; also in verse 2</li>
