<h4>Nahum 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22686">1</sup> An
oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
Elkoshite.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Anger Against Nineveh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22687">2</sup> The LORD
is a jealous and avenging God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with
wrath.<br>
The LORD takes vengeance on his foes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and maintains his wrath against his enemies.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22688">3</sup> The LORD is
slow to anger and great in power;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will not leave the guilty
unpunished.<br>
His way is in the whirlwind and the storm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and clouds are the dust of his feet.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22689">4</sup> He rebukes the
sea and dries it up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes all the rivers run dry.<br>
Bashan and Carmel wither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22690">5</sup> The mountains
quake before him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hills melt away.<br>
The earth trembles at his presence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world and all who live in it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22691">6</sup> Who can
withstand his indignation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can endure his fierce anger?<br>
His wrath is poured out like fire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rocks are shattered before him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22692">7</sup> The
LORD is good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a refuge in times of trouble.<br>
He cares for those who trust in him,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22693">8</sup> but with
an overwhelming flood<br>
he will make an end of Nineveh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will pursue his foes into darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22694">9</sup>
Whatever they plot against the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22694a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> will
bring to an end;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble will not come a second time.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22695">10</sup> They will be
entangled among thorns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drunk from their wine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be consumed like dry
stubble.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22695b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22696">11</sup> From you, O
Nineveh, has one come forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who plots evil against the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and counsels wickedness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22697">12</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Although they have allies and are
numerous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be cut off and pass away.<br>
Although I have afflicted you, O Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will afflict you no more.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22698">13</sup> Now I will
break their yoke from your neck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tear your shackles away.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22699">14</sup> The
LORD has given a command concerning you, Nineveh:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You will have no descendants to bear your
name.<br>
I will destroy the carved images and cast idols<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are in the temple of your gods.<br>
I will prepare your grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are vile.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22700">15</sup> Look,
there on the mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feet of one who brings good news,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who proclaims peace!<br>
Celebrate your festivals, O Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fulfill your vows.<br>
No more will the wicked invade you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be completely destroyed.</p>
