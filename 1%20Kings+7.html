<h4>1 Kings 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon Builds His Palace</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8936">1</sup> It took
Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of
his palace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8937">2</sup> He
built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long,
fifty wide and thirty high,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8937a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> with
four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8938">3</sup> It was roofed
with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five
beams, fifteen to a row. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8939">4</sup> Its windows were placed high in sets of
three, facing each other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8940">5</sup> All the doorways had rectangular frames;
they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each
other.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8940b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8941">6</sup> He made
a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8941c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> In front of it was a portico, and
in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8942">7</sup> He
built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge,
and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8942d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8943">8</sup> And the palace in which he was to live,
set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace
like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8944">9</sup> All
these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from
foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to
size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8945">10</sup> The foundations
were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8945e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> and some eight.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8945f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8946">11</sup> Above were high-grade stones, cut to
size, and cedar beams. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8947">12</sup> The great courtyard was surrounded by a
wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed
cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD
with its portico.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Temple’s Furnishings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8948">13</sup> King
Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8948g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8949">14</sup> whose mother was a widow from the tribe
of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in
bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of
bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned
to him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8950">15</sup> He
cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve
cubits around,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8950h"
title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> by line. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8951">16</sup> He also made two capitals
of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was
five cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8951i"
title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> high. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8952">17</sup> A network of interwoven chains
festooned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each
capital. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8953">18</sup> He
made pomegranates in two rows<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8953j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup>
encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the
pillars.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8953k" title=
"Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> He did the same for each capital.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8954">19</sup> The capitals on
top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8954l" title=
"Vea nota al pie l">l</a>]</sup> high. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8955">20</sup> On the capitals of both pillars, above
the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred
pomegranates in rows all around. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8956">21</sup> He erected the pillars at the portico of
the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8956m" title=
"Vea nota al pie m">m</a>]</sup> and the one to the north
Boaz.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8956n" title=
"Vea nota al pie n">n</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8957">22</sup> The capitals on top were in the shape of
lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8958">23</sup> He
made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8958o" title=
"Vea nota al pie o">o</a>]</sup> from rim to rim and five cubits
high. It took a line of thirty cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8958p" title=
"Vea nota al pie p">p</a>]</sup> to measure around it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8959">24</sup> Below the rim, gourds
encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in
one piece with the Sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8960">25</sup> The
Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west,
three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of
them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8961">26</sup> It was a
handbreadth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8961q"
title="Vea nota al pie q">q</a>]</sup> in thickness, and its rim
was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two
thousand baths.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8961r"
title="Vea nota al pie r">r</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8962">27</sup> He
also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long,
four wide and three high.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8962s" title="Vea nota al pie s">s</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8963">28</sup> This is how the
stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8964">29</sup> On the panels
between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the
uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths
of hammered work. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8965">30</sup> Each stand had four bronze wheels with
bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast
with wreaths on each side. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8966">31</sup> On the inside of the stand there was an
opening that had a circular frame one cubit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8966t" title=
"Vea nota al pie t">t</a>]</sup> deep. This opening was round, and
with its basework it measured a cubit and a half.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8966u" title=
"Vea nota al pie u">u</a>]</sup> Around its opening there was
engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8967">32</sup> The four wheels
were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to
the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8968">33</sup> The wheels were
made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all
of cast metal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8969">34</sup> Each
stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the
stand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8970">35</sup> At the
top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8970v" title=
"Vea nota al pie v">v</a>]</sup> deep. The supports and panels were
attached to the top of the stand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8971">36</sup> He engraved cherubim, lions and palm
trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every
available space, with wreaths all around. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8972">37</sup> This is the way he made the ten stands.
They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and
shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8973">38</sup> He
then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8973w" title=
"Vea nota al pie w">w</a>]</sup> and measuring four cubits across,
one basin to go on each of the ten stands. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8974">39</sup> He placed five of the stands on the
south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea
on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8975">40</sup> He also made
the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Huram finished all the work he had
undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8976">41</sup> the
two pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the
pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two sets of network decorating the two
bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8977">42</sup> the
four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of
pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals
on top of the pillars);</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8978">43</sup> the
ten stands with their ten basins;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8979">44</sup> the
Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8980">45</sup> the
pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these objects that Huram made for King
Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8981">46</sup> The king had
them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth
and Zarethan. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8982">47</sup>
Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so
many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8983">48</sup>
Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD’s
temple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the golden altar;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the golden table on which was the bread of the
Presence;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8984">49</sup> the
lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in
front of the inner sanctuary);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8985">50</sup> the
pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and
censers;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the gold sockets for the doors of the
innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the
main hall of the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8986">51</sup> When
all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was
finished, he brought in the things his father David had
dedicated—the silver and gold and the furnishings—and he placed
them in the treasuries of the LORD’s temple.</p>
