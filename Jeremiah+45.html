<p><h4>Jeremiah 45</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Message to Baruch</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20042">1</sup> This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20043">2</sup> “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20044">3</sup> You said, ‘Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20045">4</sup> The LORD said, “Say this to him: ‘This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20046">5</sup> Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’” </p></div></body></html>
