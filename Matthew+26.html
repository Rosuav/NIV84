<p><h4>Matthew 26</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Plot Against Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24053">1</sup> When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24054">2</sup> “As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24055">3</sup> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24056">4</sup> and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24057">5</sup> “But not during the Feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.” <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24058">6</sup> While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24059">7</sup> a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24060">8</sup> When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24061">9</sup> “This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24062">10</sup> Aware of this, Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24063">11</sup> The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24064">12</sup> When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24065">13</sup> I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24066">14</sup> Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24067">15</sup> and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty silver coins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24068">16</sup> From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <h5 class="passage-header">The Lord’s Supper</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24069">17</sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24070">18</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24071">19</sup> So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24072">20</sup> When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24073">21</sup> And while they were eating, he said, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24074">22</sup> They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely not I, Lord?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24075">23</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24076">24</sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24077">25</sup> Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“Yes, it is you.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24077a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24078">26</sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, <font class='woj'>“Take and eat; this is my body.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24079">27</sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, <font class='woj'>“Drink from it, all of you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24080">28</sup> This is my blood of the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24080b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24081">29</sup> I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24082">30</sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24083">31</sup> Then Jesus told them, <font class='woj'>“This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘I will strike the shepherd,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24083c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24084">32</sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24085">33</sup> Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24086">34</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24087">35</sup> But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. <h5 class="passage-header">Gethsemane</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24088">36</sup> Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24089">37</sup> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24090">38</sup> Then he said to them, <font class='woj'>“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24091">39</sup> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, <font class='woj'>“My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24092">40</sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. <font class='woj'>“Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?”</font> he asked Peter. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24093">41</sup> “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24094">42</sup> He went away a second time and prayed, <font class='woj'>“My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24095">43</sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24096">44</sup> So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24097">45</sup> Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, <font class='woj'>“Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24098">46</sup> Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Arrested</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24099">47</sup> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24100">48</sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24101">49</sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24102">50</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“Friend, do what you came for.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24102d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24103">51</sup> With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24104">52</sup> “Put your sword back in its place,”</font> Jesus said to him, <font class='woj'>“for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24105">53</sup> Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24106">54</sup> But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24107">55</sup> At that time Jesus said to the crowd, <font class='woj'>“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24108">56</sup> But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</font> Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. <h5 class="passage-header">Before the Sanhedrin</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24109">57</sup> Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24110">58</sup> But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24111">59</sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24112">60</sup> But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally two came forward <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24113">61</sup> and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24114">62</sup> Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24115">63</sup> But Jesus remained silent. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24115e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> the Son of God.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24116">64</sup> “Yes, it is as you say,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24117">65</sup> Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24118">66</sup> What do you think?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He is worthy of death,” they answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24119">67</sup> Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24120">68</sup> and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?” <h5 class="passage-header">Peter Disowns Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24121">69</sup> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24122">70</sup> But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24123">71</sup> Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24124">72</sup> He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24125">73</sup> After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24126">74</sup> Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately a rooster crowed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24127">75</sup> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: <font class='woj'>“Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”</font> And he went outside and wept bitterly. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24077a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24077" title="Go to Matthew 26:25">Matthew 26:25</a> Or <i>“You yourself have said it”</i></li>
