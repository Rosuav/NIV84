<p><h4>Luke 15</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25582">1</sup> Now the tax collectors and “sinners” were all gathering around to hear him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25583">2</sup> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25584">3</sup> Then Jesus told them this parable: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25585">4</sup> “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25586">5</sup> And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25587">6</sup> and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25588">7</sup> I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Lost Coin</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25589">8</sup> “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25589a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25590">9</sup> And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25591">10</sup> In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Lost Son</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25592">11</sup> Jesus continued: <font class='woj'>“There was a man who had two sons.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25593">12</sup> The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25594">13</sup> “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25595">14</sup> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25596">15</sup> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25597">16</sup> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25598">17</sup> “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25599">18</sup> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25600">19</sup> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25601">20</sup> So he got up and went to his father.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25602">21</sup> “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25602b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25603">22</sup> “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25604">23</sup> Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25605">24</sup> For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25606">25</sup> “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25607">26</sup> So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25608">27</sup> ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25609">28</sup> “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25610">29</sup> But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25611">30</sup> But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25612">31</sup> “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25613">32</sup> But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25589a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25589" title="Go to Luke 15:8">Luke 15:8</a> Greek <i>ten drachmas,</i> each worth about a day’s wages</li>
