<h4>Acts 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26940">1</sup> When the
day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26941">2</sup> Suddenly a
sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and
filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26942">3</sup> They saw what seemed to be
tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26943">4</sup> All of them
were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
tongues<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26943a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> as the Spirit enabled them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26944">5</sup> Now
there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation
under heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26945">6</sup>
When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment,
because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26946">7</sup> Utterly amazed,
they asked: “Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26947">8</sup> Then how is it
that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26948">9</sup> Parthians, Medes and
Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus
and Asia, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26949">10</sup>
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene;
visitors from Rome <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26950">11</sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism);
Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our
own tongues!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26951">12</sup>
Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this
mean?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26952">13</sup> Some,
however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much
wine.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26952b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter Addresses the Crowd</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26953">14</sup> Then
Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the
crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me
explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26954">15</sup> These men are not drunk,
as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26955">16</sup> No, this is what was
spoken by the prophet Joel:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26956">17</sup> “‘In
the last days, God says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit on all people.<br>
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your young men will see visions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your old men will dream dreams.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26957">18</sup> Even on my
servants, both men and women,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit in those days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will prophesy.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26958">19</sup> I will show
wonders in the heaven above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and signs on the earth below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood and fire and billows of smoke.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26959">20</sup> The sun will
be turned to darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon to blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the coming of the great and glorious day
of the Lord.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26960">21</sup> And everyone
who calls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the name of the Lord will be
saved.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26960c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26961">22</sup> “Men
of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited
by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among
you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26962">23</sup> This man was handed over to you by
God’s set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of
wicked men,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26962d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> put him to death by nailing him
to the cross. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26963">24</sup>
But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of
death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26964">25</sup> David said
about him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I saw the Lord always before me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is at my right hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be shaken.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26965">26</sup> Therefore my
heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my body also will live in hope,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26966">27</sup> because you
will not abandon me to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will you let your Holy One see decay.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26967">28</sup> You have made
known to me the paths of life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will fill me with joy in your
presence.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26967e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26968">29</sup>
“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died
and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26969">30</sup> But he was a prophet and
knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of
his descendants on his throne. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26970">31</sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the
resurrection of the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26970f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> that he
was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26971">32</sup> God has raised
this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26972">33</sup> Exalted to the
right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised
Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26973">34</sup> For David did
not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The Lord said to my Lord:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sit at my right hand<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26974">35</sup> until I make
your enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a footstool for your feet.”’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26974g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26975">36</sup>
“Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this
Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26976">37</sup> When
the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter
and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26977">38</sup> Peter
replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of
Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26978">39</sup> The promise is for you and your
children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God
will call.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26979">40</sup> With
many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save
yourselves from this corrupt generation.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26980">41</sup> Those who accepted his message were
baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that
day.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Fellowship of the Believers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26981">42</sup> They
devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship,
to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26982">43</sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many
wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26983">44</sup> All the believers were
together and had everything in common. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26984">45</sup> Selling their possessions and goods,
they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26985">46</sup> Every day they continued to meet
together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and
ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26986">47</sup> praising God and enjoying the favor
of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those
who were being saved.
