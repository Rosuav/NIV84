<h4>Job 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Eliphaz</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13205">1</sup> Then
Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13206">2</sup> “Would
a wise man answer with empty notions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or fill his belly with the hot east wind?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13207">3</sup> Would he argue
with useless words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with speeches that have no value?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13208">4</sup> But you even
undermine piety<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hinder devotion to God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13209">5</sup> Your sin
prompts your mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you adopt the tongue of the crafty.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13210">6</sup> Your own mouth
condemns you, not mine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your own lips testify against you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13211">7</sup> “Are
you the first man ever born?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you brought forth before the hills?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13212">8</sup> Do you listen
in on God’s council?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you limit wisdom to yourself?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13213">9</sup> What do you
know that we do not know?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What insights do you have that we do not
have?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13214">10</sup> The
gray-haired and the aged are on our side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men even older than your father.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13215">11</sup> Are God’s
consolations not enough for you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words spoken gently to you?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13216">12</sup> Why has your
heart carried you away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and why do your eyes flash,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13217">13</sup> so that you
vent your rage against God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pour out such words from your mouth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13218">14</sup> “What
is man, that he could be pure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or one born of woman, that he could be
righteous?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13219">15</sup> If God places
no trust in his holy ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13220">16</sup> how much less
man, who is vile and corrupt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who drinks up evil like water!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13221">17</sup>
“Listen to me and I will explain to you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me tell you what I have seen,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13222">18</sup> what wise men
have declared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hiding nothing received from their fathers<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13223">19</sup> (to whom alone
the land was given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when no alien passed among them):<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13224">20</sup> All his days
the wicked man suffers torment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruthless through all the years stored up for
him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13225">21</sup> Terrifying
sounds fill his ears;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when all seems well, marauders attack him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13226">22</sup> He despairs of
escaping the darkness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is marked for the sword.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13227">23</sup> He wanders
about—food for vultures<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-13227a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he knows the day of darkness is at hand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13228">24</sup> Distress and
anguish fill him with terror;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they overwhelm him, like a king poised to
attack,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13229">25</sup> because he
shakes his fist at God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vaunts himself against the Almighty,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13230">26</sup> defiantly
charging against him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a thick, strong shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13231">27</sup>
“Though his face is covered with fat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his waist bulges with flesh,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13232">28</sup> he will
inhabit ruined towns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and houses where no one lives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;houses crumbling to rubble.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13233">29</sup> He will no
longer be rich and his wealth will not endure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will his possessions spread over the
land.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13234">30</sup> He will not
escape the darkness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a flame will wither his shoots,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him
away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13235">31</sup> Let him not
deceive himself by trusting what is worthless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he will get nothing in return.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13236">32</sup> Before his
time he will be paid in full,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his branches will not flourish.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13237">33</sup> He will be
like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13238">34</sup> For the
company of the godless will be barren,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire will consume the tents of those who love
bribes.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13239">35</sup> They conceive
trouble and give birth to evil;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their womb fashions deceit.”</p>
