<p><h4>John 12</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26571">1</sup> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26572">2</sup> Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26573">3</sup> Then Mary took about a pint<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26573a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26574">4</sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26575">5</sup> “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26575b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26576">6</sup> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26577">7</sup> “Leave her alone,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26578">8</sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26579">9</sup> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26580">10</sup> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26581">11</sup> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Triumphal Entry</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26582">12</sup> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26583">13</sup> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hosanna!<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26583c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26583d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blessed is the King of Israel!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26584">14</sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26585">15</sup> “Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see, your king is coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seated on a donkey’s colt.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26585e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26586">16</sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26587">17</sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26588">18</sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26589">19</sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!” <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26590">20</sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26591">21</sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26592">22</sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26593">23</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26594">24</sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26595">25</sup> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26596">26</sup> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26597">27</sup> “Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26598">28</sup> Father, glorify your name!”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26599">29</sup> The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26600">30</sup> Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26601">31</sup> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26602">32</sup> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26603">33</sup> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26604">34</sup> The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26604f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> will remain forever, so how can you say, <font class='woj'>‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’</font>? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26605">35</sup> Then Jesus told them, <font class='woj'>“You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26606">36</sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.”</font> When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <h5 class="passage-header">The Jews Continue in Their Unbelief</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26607">37</sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26608">38</sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lord, who has believed our message <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26608g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26609">39</sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26610">40</sup> “He has blinded their eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deadened their hearts, <br />so they can neither see with their eyes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor understand with their hearts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor turn—and I would heal them.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26610h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26611">41</sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26612">42</sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26613">43</sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26614">44</sup> Then Jesus cried out, <font class='woj'>“When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26615">45</sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26616">46</sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26617">47</sup> “As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26618">48</sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26619">49</sup> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26620">50</sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-26573a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-26573" title="Go to John 12:3">John 12:3</a> Greek <i>a litra</i> (probably about 0.5 liter)</li>
