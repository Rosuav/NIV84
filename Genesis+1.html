<h4>Genesis 1</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Beginning</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1">1</sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2">2</sup> Now the earth was<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3">3</sup> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4">4</sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5">5</sup> God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6">6</sup> And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7">7</sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8">8</sup> God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9">9</sup> And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10">10</sup> God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11">11</sup> Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12">12</sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13">13</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14">14</sup> And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15">15</sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-16">16</sup> God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17">17</sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18">18</sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19">19</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20">20</sup> And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21">21</sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22">22</sup> God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23">23</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24">24</sup> And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25">25</sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26">26</sup> Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27">27</sup> So God created man in his own image, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28">28</sup> God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29">29</sup> Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30">30</sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31">31</sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-2a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-2" title="Ir a Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</a> Or possibly <i>became</i></li>
