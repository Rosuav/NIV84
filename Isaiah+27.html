<h4>Isaiah 27</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Deliverance of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18153">1</sup> In that
day,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will punish with his sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his fierce, great and powerful sword,<br>
Leviathan the gliding serpent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leviathan the coiling serpent;<br>
he will slay the monster of the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18154">2</sup> In
that day—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sing about a fruitful vineyard:<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18155">3</sup> I, the
LORD, watch over it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I water it continually.<br>
I guard it day and night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that no one may harm it.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18156">4</sup> I am not
angry.<br>
If only there were briers and thorns confronting me!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would march against them in battle;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would set them all on fire.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18157">5</sup> Or else let
them come to me for refuge;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them make peace with me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, let them make peace with me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18158">6</sup> In
days to come Jacob will take root,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel will bud and blossom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fill all the world with fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18159">7</sup> Has
the LORD struck her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he struck down those who struck her?<br>
Has she been killed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as those were killed who killed her?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18160">8</sup> By
warfare<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18160a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and exile you contend with
her—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his fierce blast he drives her out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as on a day the east wind blows.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18161">9</sup> By this, then,
will Jacob’s guilt be atoned for,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this will be the full fruitage of the removal
of his sin:<br>
When he makes all the altar stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces,<br>
no Asherah poles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18161b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> or
incense altars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be left standing.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18162">10</sup> The fortified
city stands desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the
desert;<br>
there the calves graze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there they lie down;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they strip its branches bare.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18163">11</sup> When its twigs
are dry, they are broken off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and women come and make fires with them.<br>
For this is a people without understanding;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so their Maker has no compassion on them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their Creator shows them no favor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18164">12</sup> In
that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18164c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O
Israelites, will be gathered up one by one. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-18165">13</sup> And in that day a great trumpet will
sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were
exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain
in Jerusalem.</p>
