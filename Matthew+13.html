<p><h4>Matthew 13</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Sower</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23541">1</sup> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23542">2</sup> Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23543">3</sup> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: <font class='woj'>“A farmer went out to sow his seed.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23544">4</sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23545">5</sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23546">6</sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23547">7</sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23548">8</sup> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23549">9</sup> He who has ears, let him hear.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23550">10</sup> The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23551">11</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23552">12</sup> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23553">13</sup> This is why I speak to them in parables:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Though seeing, they do not see;</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23554">14</sup> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</font> <br /><font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23555">15</sup> For this people’s heart has become calloused;</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>they hardly hear with their ears,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and they have closed their eyes.</font> <br /><font class='woj'>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>hear with their ears,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>understand with their hearts</font> <br /><font class='woj'>and turn, and I would heal them.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23555a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23556">16</sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23557">17</sup> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23558">18</sup> “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23559">19</sup> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23560">20</sup> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23561">21</sup> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23562">22</sup> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23563">23</sup> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Weeds</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23564">24</sup> Jesus told them another parable: <font class='woj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23565">25</sup> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23566">26</sup> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23567">27</sup> “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23568">28</sup> “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23569">29</sup> “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23570">30</sup> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23571">31</sup> He told them another parable: <font class='woj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23572">32</sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23573">33</sup> He told them still another parable: <font class='woj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23573b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23574">34</sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23575">35</sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will open my mouth in parables, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23575c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Weeds Explained</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23576">36</sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23577">37</sup> He answered, <font class='woj'>“The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23578">38</sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23579">39</sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23580">40</sup> “As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23581">41</sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23582">42</sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23583">43</sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23584">44</sup> “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23585">45</sup> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23586">46</sup> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Net</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23587">47</sup> “Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23588">48</sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23589">49</sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23590">50</sup> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23591">51</sup> “Have you understood all these things?”</font> Jesus asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23592">52</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">A Prophet Without Honor</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23593">53</sup> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23594">54</sup> Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23595">55</sup> “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23596">56</sup> Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23597">57</sup> And they took offense at him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23598">58</sup> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-23555a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-23555" title="Go to Matthew 13:15">Matthew 13:15</a> Isaiah 6:9,10</li>
