<h4>1 Samuel 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul Rescues the City of Jabesh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7447">1</sup> Nahash the
Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of
Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject
to you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7448">2</sup> But
Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on
the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you
and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7449">3</sup> The
elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send
messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will
surrender to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7450">4</sup> When
the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to
the people, they all wept aloud. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7451">5</sup> Just then Saul was returning from the
fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with the
people? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the
men of Jabesh had said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7452">6</sup> When
Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came upon him in power,
and he burned with anger. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7453">7</sup> He took a pair of oxen, cut them into
pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel,
proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who
does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the LORD fell
on the people, and they turned out as one man. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7454">8</sup> When Saul mustered them at
Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the
men of Judah thirty thousand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7455">9</sup> They
told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead,
‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be delivered.’” When
the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they
were elated. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7456">10</sup>
They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and
you can do to us whatever seems good to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7457">11</sup> The
next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the
last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites
and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived
were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul Confirmed as King</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7458">12</sup> The
people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul
reign over us?’ Bring these men to us and we will put them to
death.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7459">13</sup> But
Saul said, “No one shall be put to death today, for this day the
LORD has rescued Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7460">14</sup> Then
Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there
reaffirm the kingship.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7461">15</sup> So all the people went to Gilgal and
confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they
sacrificed fellowship offerings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great
celebration.</p>
