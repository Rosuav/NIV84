<h4>Matthew 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23194">1</sup> In those
days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23195">2</sup> and saying,
“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23196">3</sup> This is he who was spoken of through
the prophet Isaiah:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A voice of one calling in the desert,<br>
‘Prepare the way for the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make straight paths for him.’”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23196a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23197">4</sup> John’s
clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around
his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23198">5</sup> People went out to him
from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23199">6</sup> Confessing
their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23200">7</sup> But
when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he
was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned
you to flee from the coming wrath? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23201">8</sup> Produce fruit in keeping with
repentance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23202">9</sup> And
do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our
father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up
children for Abraham. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23203">10</sup> The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut
down and thrown into the fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23204">11</sup> “I
baptize you with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23204b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> water for
repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I,
whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit and with fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23205">12</sup> His winnowing fork is in his hand, and
he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the
barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Baptism of Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23206">13</sup> Then
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23207">14</sup> But John tried
to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you
come to me?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23208">15</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Let it be so now; it is proper for us
to do this to fulfill all righteousness.”</font> Then John
consented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23209">16</sup> As
soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that
moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
like a dove and lighting on him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23210">17</sup> And a voice from heaven said, “This is
my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”</p>
