<p><h4>Ezekiel 29</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Egypt</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21185">1</sup> In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21186">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21187">3</sup> Speak to him and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you great monster lying among your streams. <br />You say, “The Nile is mine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made it for myself.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21188">4</sup> But I will put hooks in your jaws <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. <br />I will pull you out from among your streams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all the fish sticking to your scales. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21189">5</sup> I will leave you in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you and all the fish of your streams. <br />You will fall on the open field <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not be gathered or picked up. <br />I will give you as food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21190">6</sup> Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the LORD. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘You have been a staff of reed for the house of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21191">7</sup> When they grasped you with their hands, you splintered and you tore open their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and their backs were wrenched.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21191a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21192">8</sup> “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will bring a sword against you and kill your men and their animals. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21193">9</sup> Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Because you said, “The Nile is mine; I made it,” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21194">10</sup> therefore I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21194b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21195">11</sup> No foot of man or animal will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21196">12</sup> I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21197">13</sup> “‘Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21198">14</sup> I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21198c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21199">15</sup> It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21200">16</sup> Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21201">17</sup> In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21202">18</sup> “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21203">19</sup> Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21204">20</sup> I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21205">21</sup> “On that day I will make a horn<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21205d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them.
