<h4>1 Corinthians 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28349">1</sup> Paul,
called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our
brother Sosthenes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28350">2</sup> To the
church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and
called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28351">3</sup> Grace
and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28352">4</sup> I always
thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28353">5</sup> For in him you
have been enriched in every way—in all your speaking and in all
your knowledge— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28354">6</sup>
because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28355">7</sup> Therefore you
do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord
Jesus Christ to be revealed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28356">8</sup> He will keep you strong to the end, so
that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28357">9</sup> God, who has
called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is
faithful.
<h5 class="passage-header">Divisions in the Church</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28358">10</sup> I appeal
to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of
you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among
you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28359">11</sup> My brothers,
some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are
quarrels among you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28360">12</sup> What I mean is this: One of you says,
“I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow
Cephas<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28360a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”; still another, “I follow Christ.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28361">13</sup> Is
Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized
into<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28361b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the name of Paul? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28362">14</sup> I am thankful that I did
not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28363">15</sup> so no one can say that
you were baptized into my name. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28364">16</sup> (Yes, I also baptized the household of
Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone
else.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28365">17</sup> For
Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not
with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of
its power.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Christ the Wisdom and Power of God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28366">18</sup> For the
message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but
to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28367">19</sup> For it is written:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the intelligence of the intelligent I will
frustrate.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28367c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28368">20</sup> Where
is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of
this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28369">21</sup> For since in
the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him,
God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to
save those who believe. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28370">22</sup> Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks
look for wisdom, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28371">23</sup> but we preach Christ crucified: a
stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28372">24</sup> but to those whom God has
called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the
wisdom of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28373">25</sup>
For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the
weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28374">26</sup>
Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of
you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not
many were of noble birth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28375">27</sup> But God chose the foolish things of the
world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to
shame the strong. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28376">28</sup> He chose the lowly things of this world
and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the
things that are, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28377">29</sup> so that no one may boast before him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28378">30</sup> It is because
of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom
from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28379">31</sup> Therefore, as
it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”<sup class=
