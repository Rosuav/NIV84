You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20141">13</sup> I swear by myself,” declares the LORD, “that Bozrah will become a ruin and an object of horror, of reproach and of cursing; and all its towns will be in ruins forever.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20142">14</sup> I have heard a message from the LORD: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An envoy was sent to the nations to say, <br />“Assemble yourselves to attack it! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up for battle!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20143">15</sup> “Now I will make you small among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despised among men. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20144">16</sup> The terror you inspire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the pride of your heart have deceived you, <br />you who live in the clefts of the rocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who occupy the heights of the hill. <br />Though you build your nest as high as the eagle’s, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from there I will bring you down,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20145">17</sup> “Edom will become an object of horror; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all its wounds. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20146">18</sup> As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with their neighboring towns,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD, <br />“so no one will live there; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man will dwell in it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20147">19</sup> “Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a rich pastureland, <br />I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? <br />Who is like me and who can challenge me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what shepherd can stand against me?” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20148">20</sup> Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: <br />The young of the flock will be dragged away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will completely destroy their pasture because of them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20149">21</sup> At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their cry will resound to the Red Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20149b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20150">22</sup> Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreading its wings over Bozrah. <br />In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be like the heart of a woman in labor. <h5 class="passage-header">A Message About Damascus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20151">23</sup> Concerning Damascus: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have heard bad news. <br />They are disheartened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled like<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20151c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> the restless sea. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20152">24</sup> Damascus has become feeble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she has turned to flee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and panic has gripped her; <br />anguish and pain have seized her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain like that of a woman in labor. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20153">25</sup> Why has the city of renown not been abandoned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the town in which I delight?
