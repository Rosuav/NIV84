<h4>1 Kings 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Preparations for Building the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8880">1</sup> When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8881">2</sup> Solomon sent back this message to Hiram: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8882">3</sup> “You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD put his enemies under his feet. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8883">4</sup> But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8884">5</sup> I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God, as the LORD told my father David, when he said, ‘Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8885">6</sup> “So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8886">7</sup> When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was greatly pleased and said, “Praise be to the LORD today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8887">8</sup> So Hiram sent word to Solomon: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and pine logs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8888">9</sup> My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8889">10</sup> In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8890">11</sup> and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8890a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8890b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup><sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8890c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8891">12</sup> The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8892">13</sup> King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel—thirty thousand men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8893">14</sup> He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8894">15</sup> Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8895">16</sup> as well as thirty-three hundred<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8895d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> foremen who supervised the project and directed the workmen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8896">17</sup> At the king’s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of quality stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8897">18</sup> The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and the men of Gebal<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8897e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8890a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8890" title="Ir a 1 Kings 5:11">1 Kings 5:11</a> That is, probably about 125,000 bushels (about 4,400 kiloliters)</li>
