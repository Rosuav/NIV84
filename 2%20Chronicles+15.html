<h5 class="passage-header">Asa’s Reform</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11492">1</sup> The
Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11493">2</sup> He went out to meet Asa and said to
him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is
with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found
by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11494">3</sup> For a long time Israel was
without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the
law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11495">4</sup> But in
their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and
sought him, and he was found by them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11496">5</sup> In those days it was not safe to travel
about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11497">6</sup> One nation was
being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was
troubling them with every kind of distress. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11498">7</sup> But as for you, be strong and do not
give up, for your work will be rewarded.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11499">8</sup> When
Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11499a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Oded the prophet, he took courage.
He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and
Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of
Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the
portico of the LORD’s temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11500">9</sup> Then
he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim,
Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers
had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his
God was with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11501">10</sup> They
assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of
Asa’s reign. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11502">11</sup>
At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of
cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had
brought back. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11503">12</sup>
They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their
fathers, with all their heart and soul. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11504">13</sup> All who would not seek the LORD, the
God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man
or woman. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11505">14</sup> They
took an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting and
with trumpets and horns. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11506">15</sup> All Judah rejoiced about the oath
because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly,
and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every
side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11507">16</sup> King
Asa also deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen
mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the
pole down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11508">17</sup> Although he
did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa’s heart was fully
committed to the LORD all his life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11509">18</sup> He brought into the temple of God the
silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had
dedicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11510">19</sup> There
was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.</p>
