<h4>Deuteronomy 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Tablets Like the First Ones</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5188">1</sup> At that
time the LORD said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the
first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden
chest.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5188a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5189">2</sup> I will write on the tablets the words
that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to
put them in the chest.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5190">3</sup> So I
made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets
like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two
tablets in my hands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5191">4</sup> The LORD wrote on these tablets what he
had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you
on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And
the LORD gave them to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5192">5</sup> Then I came back down the mountain and
put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me,
and they are there now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5193">6</sup> (The
Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah.
There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him
as priest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5194">7</sup> From
there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with
streams of water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5195">8</sup> At that time the LORD set apart the tribe
of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand
before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name,
as they still do today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5196">9</sup> That is why the Levites have no share or
inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as
the LORD your God told them.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5197">10</sup> Now I
had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, as I did the
first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was
not his will to destroy you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5198">11</sup> “Go,” the LORD said to me, “and lead the
people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land
that I swore to their fathers to give them.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Fear the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5199">12</sup> And now,
O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the
LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the
LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5200">13</sup> and to observe
the LORD’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your
own good?
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5201">14</sup> To the
LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the
earth and everything in it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5202">15</sup> Yet the LORD set his affection on your
forefathers and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants,
above all the nations, as it is today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5203">16</sup> Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and
do not be stiff-necked any longer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5204">17</sup> For the LORD your God is God of gods and
Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no
partiality and accepts no bribes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5205">18</sup> He defends the cause of the fatherless
and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5206">19</sup> And you are to
love those who are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5207">20</sup> Fear the LORD
your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his
name. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5208">21</sup> He is
your praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and
awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5209">22</sup> Your forefathers who went down into
Egypt were seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you
as numerous as the stars in the sky.</p>
