<h4>Numbers 13</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Exploring Canaan</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4077">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4078">2</sup> “Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4079">3</sup> So at the LORD’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4080">4</sup> These are their names: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4081">5</sup> from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4082">6</sup> from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4083">7</sup> from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4084">8</sup> from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4085">9</sup> from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4086">10</sup> from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4087">11</sup> from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4088">12</sup> from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4089">13</sup> from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4090">14</sup> from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4091">15</sup> from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4092">16</sup> These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4093">17</sup> When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4094">18</sup> See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4095">19</sup> What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4096">20</sup> How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4097">21</sup> So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4097a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Hamath. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4098">22</sup> They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4099">23</sup> When they reached the Valley of Eshcol,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4099b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4100">24</sup> That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4101">25</sup> At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land. <h5 class="passage-header">Report on the Exploration</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4102">26</sup> They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4103">27</sup> They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4104">28</sup> But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4105">29</sup> The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4106">30</sup> Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4107">31</sup> But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4108">32</sup> And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4109">33</sup> We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-4097a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-4097" title="Ir a Numbers 13:21">Numbers 13:21</a> Or <i>toward the entrance to</i></li>
