<h4>1 Samuel 14</h4>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7510">1</sup> One day
Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor,
“Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.”
But he did not tell his father.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7511">2</sup> Saul
was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in
Migron. With him were about six hundred men, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7512">3</sup> among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing
an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas,
the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that
Jonathan had left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7513">4</sup> On each
side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the
Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other
Seneh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7514">5</sup> One cliff
stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward
Geba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7515">6</sup>
Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to
the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will
act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether
by many or by few.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7516">7</sup> “Do all
that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with
you heart and soul.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7517">8</sup>
Jonathan said, “Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and
let them see us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7518">9</sup>
If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay
where we are and not go up to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7519">10</sup> But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we
will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has
given them into our hands.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7520">11</sup> So
both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!”
said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes
they were hiding in.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7521">12</sup> The men of the outpost shouted to
Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a
lesson.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb
up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7522">13</sup>
Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his
armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before
Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7523">14</sup> In that first
attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an
area of about half an acre.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7523a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel Routs the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7524">15</sup> Then
panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those
in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a
panic sent by God.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7524b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7525">16</sup> Saul’s
lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all
directions. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7526">17</sup>
Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and
see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his
armor-bearer who were not there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7527">18</sup> Saul
said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with
the Israelites.)<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7527c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7528">19</sup> While Saul was talking to the priest,
the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul
said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7529">20</sup> Then
Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found
the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their
swords. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7530">21</sup> Those
Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone
up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were
with Saul and Jonathan. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7531">22</sup> When all the Israelites who had hidden
in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on
the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7532">23</sup> So the LORD rescued Israel
that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jonathan Eats Honey</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7533">24</sup> Now the
men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the
people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be any man who eats food
before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!”
So none of the troops tasted food.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7534">25</sup> The
entire army<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7534d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> entered the woods, and there
was honey on the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7535">26</sup> When they went into the woods, they saw
the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because
they feared the oath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7536">27</sup> But Jonathan had not heard that his
father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the
end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the
honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes
brightened.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7536e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7537">28</sup> Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your
father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be any
man who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7538">29</sup>
Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how
my eyes brightened<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7538f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> when I
tasted a little of this honey. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7539">30</sup> How much better it would have been if
the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their
enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even
greater?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7540">31</sup> That
day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from
Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7541">32</sup> They pounced on the plunder and, taking
sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate
them, together with the blood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7542">33</sup> Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the
men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in
it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a
large stone over here at once.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7543">34</sup> Then he said, “Go out among the men and
tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and
slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by
eating meat with blood still in it.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everyone brought his ox that night and
slaughtered it there. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7544">35</sup> Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it
was the first time he had done this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7545">36</sup> Saul
said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder
them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do whatever seems best to you,” they
replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God
here.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7546">37</sup> So
Saul asked God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you
give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that
day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7547">38</sup> Saul
therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army,
and let us find out what sin has been committed today. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7548">39</sup> As surely as the LORD who
rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must
die.” But not one of the men said a word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7549">40</sup> Saul
then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and
Jonathan my son will stand over here.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what seems best to you,” the men
replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7550">41</sup> Then
Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Give me the right
answer.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7550g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> And Jonathan and Saul were taken
by lot, and the men were cleared. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7551">42</sup> Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and
Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7552">43</sup> Then
Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Jonathan told him, “I merely tasted a
little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7553">44</sup> Saul
said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not
die, Jonathan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7554">45</sup> But
the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about
this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD
lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did
this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he
was not put to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7555">46</sup> Then
Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their
own land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7556">47</sup> After
Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies
on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7556h" title=
"Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> of Zobah, and the Philistines.
Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7556i" title=
"Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7557">48</sup> He fought valiantly and defeated the
Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had
plundered them.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul’s Family</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7558">49</sup> Saul’s
sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older
daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7559">50</sup> His wife’s name was
Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s
army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7560">51</sup> Saul’s father Kish and
Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7561">52</sup> All
the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and
whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his
service.</p>
