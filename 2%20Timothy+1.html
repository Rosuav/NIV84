<h4>2 Timothy 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29795">1</sup> Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the
promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29796">2</sup> To
Timothy, my dear son:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and
Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Encouragement to Be Faithful</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29797">3</sup> I thank
God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience,
as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29798">4</sup> Recalling your
tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29799">5</sup> I have been
reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your
grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now
lives in you also. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29800">6</sup> For this reason I remind you to fan into
flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my
hands. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29801">7</sup> For God
did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of
love and of self-discipline.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29802">8</sup> So do
not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his
prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the
power of God, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29803">9</sup>
who has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of
anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace.
This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of
time, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29804">10</sup> but it
has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ
Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality
to light through the gospel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29805">11</sup> And of this gospel I was appointed a
herald and an apostle and a teacher. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29806">12</sup> That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet
I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am
convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for
that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29807">13</sup> What
you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with
faith and love in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29808">14</sup> Guard the good deposit that was
entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who
lives in us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29809">15</sup> You
know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me,
including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29810">16</sup> May
the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he
often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29811">17</sup> On the contrary, when he
was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29812">18</sup> May the Lord grant that
he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in
how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</p>
