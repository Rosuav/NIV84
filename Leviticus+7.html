<h4>Leviticus 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Guilt Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2881">1</sup> “‘These
are the regulations for the guilt offering, which is most holy:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2882">2</sup> The guilt
offering is to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering
is slaughtered, and its blood is to be sprinkled against the altar
on all sides. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2883">3</sup>
All its fat shall be offered: the fat tail and the fat that covers
the inner parts, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2884">4</sup>
both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the covering
of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2885">5</sup> The priest shall burn them
on the altar as an offering made to the LORD by fire. It is a guilt
offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2886">6</sup> Any
male in a priest’s family may eat it, but it must be eaten in a
holy place; it is most holy.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2887">7</sup> “‘The
same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering:
They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2888">8</sup> The priest who
offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2889">9</sup> Every grain
offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle
belongs to the priest who offers it, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2890">10</sup> and every grain offering, whether mixed
with oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Fellowship Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2891">11</sup> “‘These
are the regulations for the fellowship offering<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2891a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> a person may present to the LORD:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2892">12</sup> “‘If
he offers it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this
thank offering he is to offer cakes of bread made without yeast and
mixed with oil, wafers made without yeast and spread with oil, and
cakes of fine flour well-kneaded and mixed with oil. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2893">13</sup> Along with his fellowship
offering of thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of
bread made with yeast. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2894">14</sup> He is to bring one of each kind as an
offering, a contribution to the LORD; it belongs to the priest who
sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offerings. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2895">15</sup> The meat of his fellowship
offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; he
must leave none of it till morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2896">16</sup> “‘If,
however, his offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill
offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day he offers it, but
anything left over may be eaten on the next day. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2897">17</sup> Any meat of the sacrifice
left over till the third day must be burned up. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2898">18</sup> If any meat of the
fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be
accepted. It will not be credited to the one who offered it, for it
is impure; the person who eats any of it will be held
responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2899">19</sup> “‘Meat
that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it
must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may
eat it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2900">20</sup> But if
anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering
belonging to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2901">21</sup> If anyone
touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean
animal or any unclean, detestable thing—and then eats any of the
meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, that person
must be cut off from his people.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Eating Fat and Blood Forbidden</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2902">22</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2903">23</sup>
“Say to the Israelites: ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep
or goats. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2904">24</sup> The
fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for
any other purpose, but you must not eat it. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2905">25</sup> Anyone who eats the fat of an animal
from which an offering by fire may be<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2905b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> made to the LORD must be cut off
from his people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2906">26</sup> And wherever you live, you must not eat
the blood of any bird or animal. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2907">27</sup> If anyone eats blood, that person must
be cut off from his people.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">The Priests’ Share</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2908">28</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2909">29</sup>
“Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to
the LORD is to bring part of it as his sacrifice to the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2910">30</sup> With his own
hands he is to bring the offering made to the LORD by fire; he is
to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast
before the LORD as a wave offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2911">31</sup> The priest shall burn the fat on the
altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2912">32</sup> You are to give the right
thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2913">33</sup> The son of
Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering
shall have the right thigh as his share. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2914">34</sup> From the fellowship offerings of the
Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh
that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his
sons as their regular share from the Israelites.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2915">35</sup> This
is the portion of the offerings made to the LORD by fire that were
allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to
serve the LORD as priests. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2916">36</sup> On the day they were anointed, the LORD
commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their regular
share for the generations to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2917">37</sup> These,
then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain
offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination
offering and the fellowship offering, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2918">38</sup> which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai
on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to
the LORD, in the Desert of Sinai.</p>
