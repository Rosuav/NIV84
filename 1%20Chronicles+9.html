family (the Korahites) were responsible for guarding the thresholds
of the Tent<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10635a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> just as their fathers had

periods. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10642">26</sup> But
the four principal gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted
with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house
of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10643">27</sup> They
would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because
they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it
each morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10644">28</sup> Some
of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service;
they counted them when they were brought in and when they were
taken out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10645">29</sup>
Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the
other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the flour and wine, and
the oil, incense and spices. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10646">30</sup> But some of the priests took care of
mixing the spices. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10647">31</sup> A Levite named Mattithiah, the
firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with the
responsibility for baking the offering bread. <sup class="versenum"

the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10649">33</sup> Those
who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms
of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were
responsible for the work day and night.</p>

these were heads of Levite families, chiefs as listed in their
genealogy, and they lived in Jerusalem.</p>
