<p><h4>Matthew 18</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23728">1</sup> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23729">2</sup> He called a little child and had him stand among them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23730">3</sup> And he said: <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23731">4</sup> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23732">5</sup> “And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23733">6</sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23734">7</sup> “Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23735">8</sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23736">9</sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23737">10</sup> “See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23737a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23738">12</sup> “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23739">13</sup> And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23740">14</sup> In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">A Brother Who Sins Against You</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23741">15</sup> “If your brother sins against you,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23741b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23742">16</sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23742c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23743">17</sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23744">18</sup> “I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23744d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23744e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> loosed in heaven.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23745">19</sup> “Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23746">20</sup> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23747">21</sup> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23748">22</sup> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23748f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23749">23</sup> “Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23750">24</sup> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23750g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> was brought to him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23751">25</sup> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23752">26</sup> “The servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23753">27</sup> The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23754">28</sup> “But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23754h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23755">29</sup> “His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23756">30</sup> “But he refused.
