<p><h4>Jeremiah 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18948">1</sup> The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18949">2</sup> The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18950">3</sup> and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile. <h5 class="passage-header">The Call of Jeremiah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18951">4</sup> The word of the LORD came to me, saying, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18952">5</sup> “Before I formed you in the womb I knew<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18952a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before you were born I set you apart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18953">6</sup> “Ah, Sovereign LORD,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18954">7</sup> But the LORD said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am only a child.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18955">8</sup> Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18956">9</sup> Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “Now, I have put my words in your mouth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18957">10</sup> See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18958">11</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I see the branch of an almond tree,” I replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18959">12</sup> The LORD said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18959b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> to see that my word is fulfilled.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18960">13</sup> The word of the LORD came to me again: “What do you see?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I see a boiling pot, tilting away from the north,” I answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18961">14</sup> The LORD said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18962">15</sup> I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the LORD. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Their kings will come and set up their thrones <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; <br />they will come against all her surrounding walls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and against all the towns of Judah. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18963">16</sup> I will pronounce my judgments on my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of their wickedness in forsaking me, <br />in burning incense to other gods <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in worshiping what their hands have made. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18964">17</sup> “Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18965">18</sup> Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18966">19</sup> They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18952a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18952" title="Go to Jeremiah 1:5">Jeremiah 1:5</a> Or <i>chose</i></li>
