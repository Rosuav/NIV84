<h4>Acts 26</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27811">1</sup> Then
Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for
yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Paul motioned with his hand and began his
defense: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27812">2</sup> “King
Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I
make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27813">3</sup> and especially
so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and
controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27814">4</sup> “The
Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from
the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27815">5</sup> They have known
me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that
according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a
Pharisee. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27816">6</sup> And
now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers
that I am on trial today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27817">7</sup> This is the promise our twelve tribes
are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and
night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are
accusing me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27818">8</sup>
Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the
dead?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27819">9</sup> “I too
was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose
the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27820">10</sup> And that is just what I did in
Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the
saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote
against them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27821">11</sup>
Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them
punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession
against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27822">12</sup> “On
one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority
and commission of the chief priests. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27823">13</sup> About noon, O king, as I was on the
road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing
around me and my companions. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27824">14</sup> We all fell to the ground, and I heard
a voice saying to me in Aramaic,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27824a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
<font class='woj'>‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard
for you to kick against the goads.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27825">15</sup> “Then
I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ <font class='woj'>‘I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting,’</font> the Lord replied. <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27826">16</sup> ‘Now get
up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as
a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I
will show you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27827">17</sup> I will rescue you from your own people
and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27828">18</sup> to open
their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a
place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27829">19</sup> “So
then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from
heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27830">20</sup> First
to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea,
and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and
turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27831">21</sup> That is why the Jews
seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27832">22</sup> But I have had God’s help
to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and
great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses
said would happen— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27833">23</sup> that the Christ<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27833b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> would suffer and, as the first to
rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to
the Gentiles.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27834">24</sup> At
this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your
mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you
insane.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27835">25</sup> “I am
not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying
is true and reasonable. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27836">26</sup> The king is familiar with these things,
and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has
escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27837">27</sup> King Agrippa,
do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27838">28</sup> Then
Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you
can persuade me to be a Christian?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27839">29</sup> Paul
replied, “Short time or long—I pray God that not only you but all
who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for
these chains.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27840">30</sup> The
king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting
with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27841">31</sup>
They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said,
“This man is not doing anything that deserves death or
imprisonment.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27842">32</sup>
Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he
had not appealed to Caesar.”</p>
