<h4>Genesis 8</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-185">1</sup> But God
remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that
were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and
the waters receded. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-186">2</sup> Now the springs of the deep and the
floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped
falling from the sky. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-187">3</sup> The water receded steadily from the earth.
At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-188">4</sup> and on the
seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the
mountains of Ararat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-189">5</sup> The waters continued to recede until the
tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of
the mountains became visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-190">6</sup> After
forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-191">7</sup> and sent out a
raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried
up from the earth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-192">8</sup> Then he sent out a dove to see if the
water had receded from the surface of the ground. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-193">9</sup> But the dove could find no
place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface
of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his
hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-194">10</sup> He waited seven
more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-195">11</sup> When the dove returned to
him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive
leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-196">12</sup> He waited seven
more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not
return to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-197">13</sup> By the
first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year,
the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the
covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was
dry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-198">14</sup> By the
twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely
dry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-199">15</sup> Then
God said to Noah, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-200">16</sup> “Come out of the ark, you and your wife
and your sons and their wives. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-201">17</sup> Bring out every kind of living creature
that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that
move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be
fruitful and increase in number upon it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-202">18</sup> So Noah
came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-203">19</sup> All the animals
and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the
birds—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ark, one
kind after another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-204">20</sup> Then
Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean
animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-205">21</sup> The LORD smelled
the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse
the ground because of man, even though<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-205a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> every inclination of his heart is
evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living
creatures, as I have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-206">22</sup> “As
long as the earth endures,<br>
seedtime and harvest,<br>
cold and heat,<br>
summer and winter,<br>
day and night<br>
will never cease.”</p>
