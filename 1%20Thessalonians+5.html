<h4>1 Thessalonians 5</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29607">1</sup> Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29608">2</sup> for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29609">3</sup> While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29610">4</sup> But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29611">5</sup> You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29612">6</sup> So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29613">7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29614">8</sup> But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29615">9</sup> For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29616">10</sup> He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29617">11</sup> Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. <h5 class="passage-header">Final Instructions</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29618">12</sup> Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29619">13</sup> Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29620">14</sup> And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29621">15</sup> Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29622">16</sup> Be joyful always; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29623">17</sup> pray continually; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29624">18</sup> give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29625">19</sup> Do not put out the Spirit’s fire; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29626">20</sup> do not treat prophecies with contempt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29627">21</sup> Test everything. Hold on to the good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29628">22</sup> Avoid every kind of evil. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29629">23</sup> May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29630">24</sup> The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29631">25</sup> Brothers, pray for us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29632">26</sup> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29633">27</sup> I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29634">28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </div></body></html>
