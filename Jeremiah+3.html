<h4>Jeremiah 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19004">1</sup> “If a
man divorces his wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she leaves him and marries another man,<br>
should he return to her again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not the land be completely defiled?<br>
But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would you now return to me?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19005">2</sup> “Look up to the
barren heights and see.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any place where you have not been
ravished?<br>
By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sat like a nomad<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19005a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in the
desert.<br>
You have defiled the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your prostitution and wickedness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19006">3</sup> Therefore the
showers have been withheld,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no spring rains have fallen.<br>
Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you refuse to blush with shame.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19007">4</sup> Have you not
just called to me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘My Father, my friend from my youth,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19008">5</sup> will you always
be angry?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will your wrath continue forever?’<br>
This is how you talk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you do all the evil you can.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Unfaithful Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19009">6</sup> During
the reign of King Josiah, the LORD said to me, “Have you seen what
faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and
under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19010">7</sup> I thought that
after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not,
and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19011">8</sup> I gave faithless Israel her certificate
of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I
saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out
and committed adultery. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19012">9</sup> Because Israel’s immorality mattered so
little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with
stone and wood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19013">10</sup> In spite of all this, her unfaithful
sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in
pretense,” declares the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19014">11</sup> The
LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than
unfaithful Judah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19015">12</sup> Go, proclaim this message toward the
north:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the
LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will frown on you no longer,<br>
for I am merciful,’ declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will not be angry forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19016">13</sup> Only
acknowledge your guilt—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have rebelled against the LORD your God,<br>
you have scattered your favors to foreign gods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under every spreading tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have not obeyed me,’”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19017">14</sup>
“Return, faithless people,” declares the LORD, “for I am your
husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and
bring you to Zion. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19018">15</sup> Then I will give you shepherds after my
own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19019">16</sup> In those days,
when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the
LORD, “men will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the
LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will
not be missed, nor will another one be made. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19020">17</sup> At that time they will call
Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in
Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow
the stubbornness of their evil hearts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19021">18</sup> In those days the house of Judah will
join the house of Israel, and together they will come from a
northern land to the land I gave your forefathers as an
inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19022">19</sup> “I
myself said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘How gladly would I treat you like sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give you a desirable land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most beautiful inheritance of any
nation.’<br>
I thought you would call me ‘Father’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not turn away from following me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19023">20</sup> But like a
woman unfaithful to her husband,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you have been unfaithful to me, O house of
Israel,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19024">21</sup> A cry
is heard on the barren heights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the weeping and pleading of the people of
Israel,<br>
because they have perverted their ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have forgotten the LORD their God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19025">22</sup>
“Return, faithless people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cure you of backsliding.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, we will come to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are the LORD our God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19026">23</sup> Surely the
idolatrous commotion on the hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mountains is a deception;<br>
surely in the LORD our God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the salvation of Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19027">24</sup> From our youth
shameful gods have consumed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fruits of our fathers’ labor—<br>
their flocks and herds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their sons and daughters.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19028">25</sup> Let us lie
down in our shame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let our disgrace cover us.<br>
We have sinned against the LORD our God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both we and our fathers;<br>
from our youth till this day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have not obeyed the LORD our God.”</p>
