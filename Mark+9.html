<p><h4>Mark 9</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24536">1</sup> And he said to them, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Transfiguration</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24537">2</sup> After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24538">3</sup> His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24539">4</sup> And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24540">5</sup> Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24541">6</sup> (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24542">7</sup> Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24543">8</sup> Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24544">9</sup> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24545">10</sup> They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24546">11</sup> And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24547">12</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24548">13</sup> But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Healing of a Boy With an Evil Spirit</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24549">14</sup> When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24550">15</sup> As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24551">16</sup> “What are you arguing with them about?”</font> he asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24552">17</sup> A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24553">18</sup> Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24554">19</sup> “O unbelieving generation,”</font> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24555">20</sup> So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24556">21</sup> Jesus asked the boy’s father, <font class='woj'>“How long has he been like this?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From childhood,” he answered. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24557">22</sup> “It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24558">23</sup> “‘If you can’?”</font> said Jesus. <font class='woj'>“Everything is possible for him who believes.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24559">24</sup> Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24560">25</sup> When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24560a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> spirit. <font class='woj'>“You deaf and mute spirit,”</font> he said, <font class='woj'>“I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24561">26</sup> The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24562">27</sup> But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24563">28</sup> After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24564">29</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“This kind can come out only by prayer.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24564b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24565">30</sup> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24566">31</sup> because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, <font class='woj'>“The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24567">32</sup> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. <h5 class="passage-header">Who Is the Greatest?</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24568">33</sup> They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, <font class='woj'>“What were you arguing about on the road?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24569">34</sup> But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24570">35</sup> Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, <font class='woj'>“If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24571">36</sup> He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24572">37</sup> “Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Whoever Is Not Against Us Is for Us</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24573">38</sup> “Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24574">39</sup> “Do not stop him,”</font> Jesus said. <font class='woj'>“No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24575">40</sup> for whoever is not against us is for us.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24576">41</sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Causing to Sin</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24577">42</sup> “And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24578">43</sup> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24578c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24579">45</sup> And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24579d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24580">47</sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24581">48</sup> where</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘their worm does not die,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and the fire is not quenched.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24581e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24582">49</sup> Everyone will be salted with fire.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24583">50</sup> “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again?
