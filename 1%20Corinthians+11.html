<h4>1 Corinthians 11</h4>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28586">1</sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <h5 class="passage-header">Propriety in Worship</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28587">2</sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28587a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> just as I passed them on to you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28588">3</sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28589">4</sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28590">5</sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28591">6</sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28592">7</sup> A man ought not to cover his head,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28592b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28593">8</sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28594">9</sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28595">10</sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28596">11</sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28597">12</sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28598">13</sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28599">14</sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28600">15</sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28601">16</sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God. <h5 class="passage-header">The Lord’s Supper</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28602">17</sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28603">18</sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28604">19</sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28605">20</sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28606">21</sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28607">22</sup> Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28608">23</sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28609">24</sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <font class='woj'>“This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28610">25</sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, <font class='woj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28611">26</sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28612">27</sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28613">28</sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28614">29</sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28615">30</sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28616">31</sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28617">32</sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28618">33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28619">34</sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I come I will give further directions. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28587a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28587" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</a> Or <i>traditions</i></li>
