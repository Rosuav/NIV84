<h4>Isaiah 42</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Servant of the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18482">1</sup> “Here is
my servant, whom I uphold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my chosen one in whom I delight;<br>
I will put my Spirit on him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will bring justice to the nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18483">2</sup> He will not
shout or cry out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or raise his voice in the streets.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18484">3</sup> A bruised reed
he will not break,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.<br>
In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18485">4</sup> he will
not falter or be discouraged<br>
till he establishes justice on earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his law the islands will put their hope.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18486">5</sup> This
is what God the LORD says—<br>
he who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who spread out the earth and all that comes out
of it,<br>
who gives breath to its people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and life to those who walk on it:<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18487">6</sup> “I, the LORD,
have called you in righteousness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take hold of your hand.<br>
I will keep you and will make you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be a covenant for the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a light for the Gentiles,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18488">7</sup> to open eyes
that are blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to free captives from prison<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to release from the dungeon those who sit in
darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18489">8</sup> “I am
the LORD; that is my name!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not give my glory to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or my praise to idols.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18490">9</sup> See, the former
things have taken place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and new things I declare;<br>
before they spring into being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announce them to you.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Song of Praise to the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18491">10</sup> Sing to
the LORD a new song,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his praise from the ends of the earth,<br>
you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you islands, and all who live in them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18492">11</sup> Let the desert
and its towns raise their voices;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the settlements where Kedar lives
rejoice.<br>
Let the people of Sela sing for joy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them shout from the mountaintops.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18493">12</sup> Let them give
glory to the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and proclaim his praise in the islands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18494">13</sup> The LORD will
march out like a mighty man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a warrior he will stir up his zeal;<br>
with a shout he will raise the battle cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will triumph over his enemies.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18495">14</sup> “For
a long time I have kept silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been quiet and held myself back.<br>
But now, like a woman in childbirth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cry out, I gasp and pant.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18496">15</sup> I will lay
waste the mountains and hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dry up all their vegetation;<br>
I will turn rivers into islands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dry up the pools.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18497">16</sup> I will lead
the blind by ways they have not known,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along unfamiliar paths I will guide them;<br>
I will turn the darkness into light before them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make the rough places smooth.<br>
These are the things I will do;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not forsake them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18498">17</sup> But those who
trust in idols,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be turned back in utter shame.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel Blind and Deaf</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18499">18</sup> “Hear,
you deaf;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look, you blind, and see!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18500">19</sup> Who is blind
but my servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deaf like the messenger I send?<br>
Who is blind like the one committed to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind like the servant of the LORD?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18501">20</sup> You have seen
many things, but have paid no attention;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your ears are open, but you hear nothing.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18502">21</sup> It pleased the
LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sake of his righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make his law great and glorious.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18503">22</sup> But this is a
people plundered and looted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of them trapped in pits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or hidden away in prisons.<br>
They have become plunder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one to rescue them;<br>
they have been made loot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one to say, “Send them back.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18504">23</sup> Which
of you will listen to this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pay close attention in time to come?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18505">24</sup> Who handed
Jacob over to become loot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Israel to the plunderers?<br>
Was it not the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against whom we have sinned?<br>
For they would not follow his ways;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they did not obey his law.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18506">25</sup> So he poured
out on them his burning anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the violence of war.<br>
It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it consumed them, but they did not take it to
heart.</p>
