<h4>Deuteronomy 34</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5841">1</sup> Then Moses
climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah,
across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land—from
Gilead to Dan, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5842">2</sup>
all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the
land of Judah as far as the western sea,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5842a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5843">3</sup> the Negev and the whole region from the
Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5844">4</sup> Then the LORD said to him,
“This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you
see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5845">5</sup> And
Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had
said. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5846">6</sup> He buried
him<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5846b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> in Moab, in the valley opposite
Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5847">7</sup> Moses was a
hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not
weak nor his strength gone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5848">8</sup> The Israelites grieved for Moses in the
plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning
was over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5849">9</sup> Now
Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5849c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of wisdom because Moses had laid
his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what
the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5850">10</sup> Since
then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew
face to face, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5851">11</sup>
who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to
do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole
land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5852">12</sup> For no
one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds
that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.</p>
