<h4>1 Corinthians 2</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28380">1</sup> When I
came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior
wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28380a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28381">2</sup> For I resolved to know nothing while I
was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28382">3</sup> I came to you in weakness
and fear, and with much trembling. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28383">4</sup> My message and my preaching were not
with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the
Spirit’s power, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28384">5</sup>
so that your faith might not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s
power.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Wisdom From the Spirit</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28385">6</sup> We do,
however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the
wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to
nothing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28386">7</sup> No, we
speak of God’s secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and
that God destined for our glory before time began. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28387">8</sup> None of the rulers of this
age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified
the Lord of glory. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28388">9</sup> However, as it is written:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No eye has seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no ear has heard,<br>
no mind has conceived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what God has prepared for those who love
him”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28388b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>—</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28389">10</sup> but
God has revealed it to us by his Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit searches all things, even the deep
things of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28390">11</sup>
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man’s
spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God
except the Spirit of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28391">12</sup> We have not received the spirit of the
world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what
God has freely given us. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28392">13</sup> This is what we speak, not in words
taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit,
expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28392c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28393">14</sup> The man without the Spirit does not
accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are
spiritually discerned. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28394">15</sup> The spiritual man makes judgments about
all things, but he himself is not subject to any man’s
judgment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28395">16</sup> “For
who has known the mind of the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he may instruct him?”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28395d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
