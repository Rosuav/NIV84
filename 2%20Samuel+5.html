<h4>2 Samuel 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Becomes King Over Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8134">1</sup> All the
tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own
flesh and blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8135">2</sup>
In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led
Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD said to you, ‘You
will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8136">3</sup> When
all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king
made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they
anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8137">4</sup> David
was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty
years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8138">5</sup> In Hebron
he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem
he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Conquers Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8139">6</sup> The king
and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived
there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even
the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David
cannot get in here.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8140">7</sup> Nevertheless, David captured the fortress
of Zion, the City of David.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8141">8</sup> On that
day, David said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to
use the water shaft<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8141a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to
reach those ‘lame and blind’ who are David’s enemies.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8141b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>” That is why they say, “The ‘blind
and lame’ will not enter the palace.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8142">9</sup> David
then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of
David. He built up the area around it, from the supporting
terraces<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8142c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> inward. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8143">10</sup> And he became more and more powerful,
because the LORD God Almighty was with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8144">11</sup> Now
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs
and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8145">12</sup> And David knew
that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had
exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8146">13</sup> After
he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem,
and more sons and daughters were born to him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8147">14</sup> These are the names of the children
born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8148">15</sup> Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg,
Japhia, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8149">16</sup>
Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Defeats the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8150">17</sup> When the
Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel,
they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about
it and went down to the stronghold. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8151">18</sup> Now the Philistines had come and spread
out in the Valley of Rephaim; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8152">19</sup> so David inquired of the LORD, “Shall I
go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD answered him, “Go, for I will surely
hand the Philistines over to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8153">20</sup> So
David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said,
“As waters break out, the LORD has broken out against my enemies
before me.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8153d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8154">21</sup> The Philistines abandoned their idols
there, and David and his men carried them off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8155">22</sup> Once
more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of
Rephaim; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8156">23</sup> so
David inquired of the LORD, and he answered, “Do not go straight
up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the
balsam trees. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8157">24</sup>
As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam
trees, move quickly, because that will mean the LORD has gone out
in front of you to strike the Philistine army.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8158">25</sup> So David did as the LORD
commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from
Gibeon<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8158e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> to Gezer.</p>
