<h4>1 Samuel 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul and the Witch of Endor</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7944">1</sup> In those
days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel.
Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men
will accompany me in the army.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7945">2</sup> David
said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can
do.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my
bodyguard for life.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7946">3</sup> Now
Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him
in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and
spiritists from the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7947">4</sup> The
Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while
Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7948">5</sup> When Saul saw
the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7949">6</sup> He inquired of
the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or
prophets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7950">7</sup> Saul
then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I
may go and inquire of her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is one in Endor,” they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7951">8</sup> So Saul
disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and
two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and
bring up for me the one I name.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7952">9</sup> But the
woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut
off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a
trap for my life to bring about my death?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7953">10</sup> Saul
swore to her by the LORD, “As surely as the LORD lives, you will
not be punished for this.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7954">11</sup> Then
the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bring up Samuel,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7955">12</sup> When
the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and
said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7956">13</sup> The
king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman said, “I see a spirit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7956a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> coming up out of the ground.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7957">14</sup> “What
does he look like?” he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she
said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed
down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7958">15</sup> Samuel
said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The
Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from
me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I
have called on you to tell me what to do.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7959">16</sup> Samuel
said, “Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away
from you and become your enemy? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7960">17</sup> The LORD has done what he predicted
through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and
given it to one of your neighbors—to David. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7961">18</sup> Because you did not obey the LORD or
carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has
done this to you today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7962">19</sup> The LORD will hand over both Israel and
you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with
me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the
Philistines.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7963">20</sup>
Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear
because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten
nothing all that day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7964">21</sup> When
the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she
said, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my
hands and did what you told me to do. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7965">22</sup> Now please listen to your servant and
let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to
go on your way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7966">23</sup> He
refused and said, “I will not eat.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his men joined the woman in urging him,
and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the
couch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7967">24</sup> The
woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at
once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without
yeast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7968">25</sup> Then she
set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they
got up and left.</p>
