<h4>2 Corinthians 2</h4>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28810">1</sup> So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28811">2</sup> For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28812">3</sup> I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28813">4</sup> For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you. <h5 class="passage-header">Forgiveness for the Sinner</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28814">5</sup> If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent—not to put it too severely. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28815">6</sup> The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28816">7</sup> Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28817">8</sup> I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28818">9</sup> The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28819">10</sup> If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28820">11</sup> in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. <h5 class="passage-header">Ministers of the New Covenant</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28821">12</sup> Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28822">13</sup> I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28823">14</sup> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28824">15</sup> For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28825">16</sup> To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28826">17</sup> Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God. </div></body></html>
