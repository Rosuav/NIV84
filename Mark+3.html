<p><h4>Mark 3</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24287">1</sup> Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24288">2</sup> Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24289">3</sup> Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, <font class='woj'>“Stand up in front of everyone.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24290">4</sup> Then Jesus asked them, <font class='woj'>“Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”</font> But they remained silent. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24291">5</sup> He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, <font class='woj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</font> He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24292">6</sup> Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. <h5 class="passage-header">Crowds Follow Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24293">7</sup> Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24294">8</sup> When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24295">9</sup> Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24296">10</sup> For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24297">11</sup> Whenever the evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24297a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24298">12</sup> But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was. <h5 class="passage-header">The Appointing of the Twelve Apostles</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24299">13</sup> Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24300">14</sup> He appointed twelve—designating them apostles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24300b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>—that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24301">15</sup> and to have authority to drive out demons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24302">16</sup> These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24303">17</sup> James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder); <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24304">18</sup> Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24305">19</sup> and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus and Beelzebub</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24306">20</sup> Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24307">21</sup> When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24308">22</sup> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebub<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24308c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24309">23</sup> So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: <font class='woj'>“How can Satan drive out Satan?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24310">24</sup> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24311">25</sup> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24312">26</sup> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24313">27</sup> In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24314">28</sup> I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24315">29</sup> But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24316">30</sup> He said this because they were saying, “He has an evil spirit.” <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24317">31</sup> Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24318">32</sup> A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24319">33</sup> “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</font> he asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24320">34</sup> Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, <font class='woj'>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24321">35</sup> Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24297a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24297" title="Go to Mark 3:11">Mark 3:11</a> Greek <i>unclean</i>; also in verse 30</li>
