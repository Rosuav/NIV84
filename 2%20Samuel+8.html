Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8221">11</sup> King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8222">12</sup> Edom<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8222e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek.
