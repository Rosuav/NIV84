<h4>Jeremiah 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Covenant Is Broken</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19228">1</sup> This is
the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19229">2</sup> “Listen to the terms of this covenant
and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19230">3</sup> Tell
them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed
is the man who does not obey the terms of this covenant—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19231">4</sup> the terms I
commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt, out of
the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I
command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19232">5</sup> Then I will
fulfill the oath I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land
flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, “Amen, LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19233">6</sup> The
LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this
covenant and follow them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19234">7</sup> From the time I brought your forefathers
up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying,
“Obey me.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19235">8</sup> But
they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the
stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the
curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they
did not keep.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19236">9</sup> Then
the LORD said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of
Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19237">10</sup> They have returned to the sins of their
forefathers, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed
other gods to serve them. Both the house of Israel and the house of
Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19238">11</sup> Therefore this
is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot
escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19239">12</sup> The towns of
Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods
to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when
disaster strikes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19240">13</sup> You have as many gods as you have
towns, O Judah; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to
that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of
Jerusalem.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19241">14</sup> “Do
not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them,
because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their
distress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19242">15</sup> “What
is my beloved doing in my temple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as she works out her evil schemes with many?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can consecrated meat avert your punishment?<br>
When you engage in your wickedness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then you rejoice.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19242a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19243">16</sup> The
LORD called you a thriving olive tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fruit beautiful in form.<br>
But with the roar of a mighty storm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will set it on fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its branches will be broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19244">17</sup> The
LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you,
because the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done evil
and provoked me to anger by burning incense to Baal.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Plot Against Jeremiah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19245">18</sup> Because
the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he
showed me what they were doing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19246">19</sup> I had been like a gentle lamb led to
the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me,
saying,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us cut him off from the land of the
living,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that his name be remembered no more.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19247">20</sup> But, O LORD
Almighty, you who judge righteously<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and test the heart and mind,<br>
let me see your vengeance upon them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to you I have committed my cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19248">21</sup>
“Therefore this is what the LORD says about the men of Anathoth who
are seeking your life and saying, ‘Do not prophesy in the name of
the LORD or you will die by our hands’— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19249">22</sup> therefore this is what the LORD
Almighty says: ‘I will punish them. Their young men will die by the
sword, their sons and daughters by famine. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19250">23</sup> Not even a remnant will be left to
them, because I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth in the
year of their punishment.’”</p>
