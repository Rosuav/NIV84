<h4>Hebrews 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Melchizedek the Priest</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30050">1</sup> This
Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met
Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30051">2</sup> and Abraham
gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means “king of
righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30052">3</sup> Without father
or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of
life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30053">4</sup> Just
think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth
of the plunder! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30054">5</sup>
Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to
collect a tenth from the people—that is, their brothers—even though
their brothers are descended from Abraham. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30055">6</sup> This man, however, did not trace his
descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and
blessed him who had the promises. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30056">7</sup> And without doubt the lesser person is
blessed by the greater. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30057">8</sup> In the one case, the tenth is collected
by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be
living. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30058">9</sup> One
might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth
through Abraham, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30059">10</sup> because when Melchizedek met Abraham,
Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Like Melchizedek</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30060">11</sup> If
perfection could have been attained through the Levitical
priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the
people), why was there still need for another priest to come—one in
the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30061">12</sup> For when there is a
change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30062">13</sup> He of whom
these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one
from that tribe has ever served at the altar. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30063">14</sup> For it is clear that our Lord
descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said
nothing about priests. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30064">15</sup> And what we have said is even more
clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30065">16</sup> one who has become a
priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on
the basis of the power of an indestructible life. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30066">17</sup> For it is declared:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are a priest forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the order of Melchizedek.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30066a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30067">18</sup> The
former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30068">19</sup> (for the law
made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we
draw near to God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30069">20</sup> And
it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30070">21</sup> but he became
a priest with an oath when God said to him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lord has sworn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not change his mind:<br>
‘You are a priest forever.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30070b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30071">22</sup>
Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better
covenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30072">23</sup> Now
there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them
from continuing in office; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30073">24</sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has
a permanent priesthood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30074">25</sup> Therefore he is able to save
completely<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30074c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> those who come to God
through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30075">26</sup> Such
a high priest meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set
apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30076">27</sup> Unlike the other high
priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first
for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He
sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30077">28</sup> For the law
appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came
after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect
forever.</p>
