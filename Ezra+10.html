<h4>Ezra 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The People’s Confession of Sin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12254">1</sup> While
Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down
before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and
children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12255">2</sup> Then Shecaniah son of
Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been
unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples
around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12256">3</sup> Now let us make
a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their
children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those
who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the
Law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12257">4</sup> Rise up;
this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage
and do it.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12258">5</sup> So
Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel
under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12259">6</sup> Then Ezra
withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of
Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and
drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the
unfaithfulness of the exiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12260">7</sup> A
proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all
the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12261">8</sup> Anyone who failed to appear within three
days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the
decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled
from the assembly of the exiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12262">9</sup> Within
the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in
Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the
people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly
distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12263">10</sup> Then Ezra the priest
stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have
married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12264">11</sup> Now make confession to
the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate
yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign
wives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12265">12</sup> The
whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must
do as you say. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12266">13</sup>
But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we
cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of
in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12267">14</sup> Let our
officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our
towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along
with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of
our God in this matter is turned away from us.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12268">15</sup> Only Jonathan son of
Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and
Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12269">16</sup> So
the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who
were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them
designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat
down to investigate the cases, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12270">17</sup> and by the first day of the first month
they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign
women.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Those Guilty of Intermarriage</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12271">18</sup> Among
the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign
women:

and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12272">19</sup> (They all gave
their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt
they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)</p>
