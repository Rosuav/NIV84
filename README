Bible Gateway (www.biblegateway.com) has pulled down its NIV-1984 translation
of the Bible. This is disappointing, especially for those of us who have
used Bible Gateway as a means of reading electronically what the rest of the
congregation is reading in their paper Bibles. Fortunately, the Internet
Archive never forgets anything, so I devised this script to fetch all the
content of this translation of the Bible. It's a little messy, but that may
change if I find the time.

Content is presumably still copyright Zondervan 1984 and use is presumably
still governed by their terms and conditions. This repository is simply an
easier-to-access form of archive.
