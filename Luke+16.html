<p><h4>Luke 16</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Shrewd Manager</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25614">1</sup> Jesus told his disciples: <font class='woj'>“There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25615">2</sup> So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25616">3</sup> “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25617">4</sup> I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25618">5</sup> “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25619">6</sup> “‘Eight hundred gallons<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25619a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of olive oil,’ he replied.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25620">7</sup> “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘A thousand bushels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25620b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of wheat,’ he replied.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25621">8</sup> “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25622">9</sup> I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25623">10</sup> “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25624">11</sup> So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25625">12</sup> And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25626">13</sup> “No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25627">14</sup> The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25628">15</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God’s sight.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Additional Teachings</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25629">16</sup> “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25630">17</sup> It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25631">18</sup> “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Rich Man and Lazarus</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25632">19</sup> “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25633">20</sup> At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25634">21</sup> and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25635">22</sup> “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25636">23</sup> In hell,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25636c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25637">24</sup> So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25638">25</sup> “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25639">26</sup> And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25640">27</sup> “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25641">28</sup> for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25642">29</sup> “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25643">30</sup> “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25644">31</sup> “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25619a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25619" title="Go to Luke 16:6">Luke 16:6</a> Greek <i>one hundred batous</i> (probably about 3 kiloliters)</li>
