<h4>2 Samuel 7</h4><h5 class="passage-header">God’s Promise to David</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8182">1</sup> After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8183">2</sup> he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8184">3</sup> Nathan replied to the king, “Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8185">4</sup> That night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8186">5</sup> “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8187">6</sup> I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8188">7</sup> Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8189">8</sup> “Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8190">9</sup> I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men of the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8191">10</sup> And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8192">11</sup> and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8192a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8193">12</sup> When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8194">13</sup> He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8195">14</sup> I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8196">15</sup> But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8197">16</sup> Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8197b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; your throne will be established forever.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8198">17</sup> Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. <h5 class="passage-header">David’s Prayer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8199">18</sup> Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8200">19</sup> And as if this were not enough in your sight, O Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant. Is this your usual way of dealing with man, O Sovereign LORD? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8201">20</sup> “What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8202">21</sup> For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8203">22</sup> “How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8204">23</sup> And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8204c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8205">24</sup> You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8206">25</sup> “And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8207">26</sup> so that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, ‘The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!’ And the house of your servant David will be established before you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8208">27</sup> “O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, ‘I will build a house for you.’ So your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8209">28</sup> O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8210">29</sup> Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8192a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8192" title="Ir a 2 Samuel 7:11">2 Samuel 7:11</a> Traditionally <i>judges</i></li>
