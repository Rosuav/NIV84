<h4>Genesis 30</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-832">1</sup> When
Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became
jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or
I’ll die!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-833">2</sup> Jacob
became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has
kept you from having children?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-834">3</sup> Then she
said, “Here is Bilhah, my maidservant. Sleep with her so that she
can bear children for me and that through her I too can build a
family.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-835">4</sup> So she
gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-836">5</sup> and she became
pregnant and bore him a son. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-837">6</sup> Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me;
he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she
named him Dan.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-837a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-838">7</sup> Rachel’s
servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-839">8</sup> Then Rachel said,
“I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So
she named him Naphtali.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-839b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-840">9</sup> When
Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her
maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-841">10</sup> Leah’s servant Zilpah bore
Jacob a son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-842">11</sup>
Then Leah said, “What good fortune!”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-842c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> So she
named him Gad.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-842d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-843">12</sup> Leah’s
servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-844">13</sup> Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The
women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-844e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-845">14</sup> During
wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some
mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said
to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-846">15</sup> But she
said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will
you take my son’s mandrakes too?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with
you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-847">16</sup> So when
Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet
him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my
son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-848">17</sup> God
listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth
son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-849">18</sup> Then Leah
said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my
husband.” So she named him Issachar.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-849f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-850">19</sup> Leah
conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-851">20</sup> Then Leah said, “God has presented me
with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with
honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him
Zebulun.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-851g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-852">21</sup> Some
time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-853">22</sup> Then
God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and opened her womb.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-854">23</sup> She became
pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my
disgrace.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-855">24</sup> She
named him Joseph,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-855h"
title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> and said, “May the LORD add
to me another son.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob’s Flocks Increase</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-856">25</sup> After
Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my
way so I can go back to my own homeland. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-857">26</sup> Give me my wives and children, for whom I
have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work
I’ve done for you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-858">27</sup> But
Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please
stay. I have learned by divination that<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-858i" title=
"Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> the LORD has blessed me because of
you.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-859">28</sup> He added,
“Name your wages, and I will pay them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-860">29</sup> Jacob
said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your
livestock has fared under my care. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-861">30</sup> The little you had before I came has
increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have
been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-862">31</sup> “What
shall I give you?” he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But
if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your
flocks and watching over them: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-863">32</sup> Let me go through all your flocks today
and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every
dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be
my wages. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-864">33</sup> And my
honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on
the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not
speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be
considered stolen.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-865">34</sup>
“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-866">35</sup> That same day he removed
all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the
speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and
all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his
sons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-867">36</sup> Then he
put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob
continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-868">37</sup> Jacob,
however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane
trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and
exposing the white inner wood of the branches. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-869">38</sup> Then he placed the peeled
branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be
directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the
flocks were in heat and came to drink, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-870">39</sup> they mated in front of the branches. And
they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-871">40</sup> Jacob set apart
the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the
streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he
made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s
animals. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-872">41</sup>
Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the
branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate
near the branches, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-873">42</sup> but if the animals were weak, he would
not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the
strong ones to Jacob. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-874">43</sup> In this way the man grew exceedingly
prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and
menservants, and camels and donkeys.</p>
