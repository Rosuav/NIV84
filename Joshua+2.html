<h4>Joshua 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Rahab and the Spies</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5871">1</sup> Then
Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look
over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and
entered the house of a prostitute<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5871a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> named
Rahab and stayed there.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5872">2</sup> The
king of Jericho was told, “Look! Some of the Israelites have come
here tonight to spy out the land.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5873">3</sup> So the king of Jericho sent this message
to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your
house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5874">4</sup> But the
woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the
men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5875">5</sup> At dusk, when it
was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don’t know which
way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5876">6</sup> (But she had
taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax
she had laid out on the roof.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5877">7</sup> So the men set out in pursuit of the
spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as
soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5878">8</sup> Before
the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5879">9</sup> and said to
them, “I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a
great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this
country are melting in fear because of you. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5880">10</sup> We have heard how the LORD dried up
the water of the Red Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5880b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> for you
when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the
two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely
destroyed.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5880c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5881">11</sup> When we heard of it, our hearts melted
and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God
is God in heaven above and on the earth below. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5882">12</sup> Now then, please swear to
me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I
have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5883">13</sup> that you will spare the
lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who
belong to them, and that you will save us from death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5884">14</sup> “Our
lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what
we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD
gives us the land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5885">15</sup> So she
let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived
in was part of the city wall. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5886">16</sup> Now she had said to them, “Go to the
hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there
three days until they return, and then go on your way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5887">17</sup> The
men said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding
on us <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5888">18</sup> unless,
when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the
window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought
your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your
house. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5889">19</sup> If
anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be
on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is
in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is
laid on him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5890">20</sup>
But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the
oath you made us swear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5891">21</sup>
“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them
away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the
window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5892">22</sup> When
they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days,
until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned
without finding them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5893">23</sup> Then the two men started back. They went
down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of
Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5894">24</sup> They said to Joshua, “The
LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people
are melting in fear because of us.”</p>
