<h4>Numbers 24</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4448">1</sup> Now
when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did
not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward
the desert. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4449">2</sup> When
Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the
Spirit of God came upon him <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4450">3</sup> and he uttered his oracle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4451">4</sup> the oracle of
one who hears the words of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who sees a vision from the Almighty,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4451a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are
opened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4452">5</sup> “How
beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your dwelling places, O Israel!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4453">6</sup> “Like
valleys they spread out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like gardens beside a river,<br>
like aloes planted by the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like cedars beside the waters.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4454">7</sup> Water will flow
from their buckets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their seed will have abundant water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Their king will be greater than Agag;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their kingdom will be exalted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4455">8</sup> “God
brought them out of Egypt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have the strength of a wild ox.<br>
They devour hostile nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and break their bones in pieces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their arrows they pierce them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4456">9</sup> Like a lion they
crouch and lie down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lioness—who dares to rouse them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“May those who bless you be blessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who curse you be cursed!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4457">10</sup> Then
Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together
and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have
blessed them these three times. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4458">11</sup> Now leave at once and go home! I said I
would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being
rewarded.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4459">12</sup> Balaam
answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4460">13</sup> ‘Even if Balak
gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do
anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of
the LORD—and I must say only what the LORD says’? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4461">14</sup> Now I am going back to my
people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to
your people in days to come.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Balaam’s Fourth Oracle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4462">15</sup> Then he
uttered his oracle:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4463">16</sup> the oracle of
one who hears the words of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has knowledge from the Most High,<br>
who sees a vision from the Almighty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are
opened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4464">17</sup> “I see
him, but not now;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I behold him, but not near.<br>
A star will come out of Jacob;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a scepter will rise out of Israel.<br>
He will crush the foreheads of Moab,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the skulls<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4465">18</sup> Edom will be
conquered;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seir, his enemy, will be conquered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Israel will grow strong.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4466">19</sup> A ruler will
come out of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy the survivors of the city.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Balaam’s Final Oracles</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4467">20</sup> Then
Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Amalek was first among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he will come to ruin at last.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4468">21</sup> Then
he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your dwelling place is secure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your nest is set in a rock;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4469">22</sup> yet you Kenites
will be destroyed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Asshur takes you captive.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4470">23</sup> Then
he uttered his oracle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah, who can live when God does
this?<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4470e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4471">24</sup> Ships
will come from the shores of Kittim;<br>
they will subdue Asshur and Eber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they too will come to ruin.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4472">25</sup> Then
Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.</p>
