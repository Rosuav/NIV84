<h5 class="passage-header">Azariah King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9927">1</sup> In the
twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of
Amaziah king of Judah began to reign. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9928">2</sup> He was sixteen years old when he became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s
name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9929">3</sup> He did what was right in the eyes of
the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9930">4</sup> The high places, however,
were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn
incense there.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9931">5</sup> The
LORD afflicted the king with leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9931a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> until
the day he died, and he lived in a separate house.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9931b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Jotham the king’s son had charge
of the palace and governed the people of the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9932">6</sup> As for
the other events of Azariah’s reign, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9933">7</sup> Azariah rested
with his fathers and was buried near them in the City of David. And
Jotham his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zechariah King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9934">8</sup> In the
thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah son of
Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned six
months. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9935">9</sup> He did
evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not
turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had
caused Israel to commit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9936">10</sup>
Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He attacked him
in front of the people,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9936c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>
assassinated him and succeeded him as king. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9937">11</sup> The other events of Zechariah’s reign
are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9938">12</sup> So the word of
the LORD spoken to Jehu was fulfilled: “Your descendants will sit
on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”<sup class=

"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>

&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9939">13</sup> Shallum
son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king
of Judah, and he reigned in Samaria one month. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9940">14</sup> Then Menahem son of Gadi
went from Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh
in Samaria, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9941">15</sup> The
other events of Shallum’s reign, and the conspiracy he led, are
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9942">16</sup> At
that time Menahem, starting out from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and
everyone in the city and its vicinity, because they refused to open
their gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant
women.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Menahem King of Israel</h5>

thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi
became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9944">18</sup> He did evil in
the eyes of the LORD. During his entire reign he did not turn away
from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel
to commit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9945">19</sup> Then
Pul<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9945e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> king of Assyria invaded the land,
and Menahem gave him a thousand talents<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9945f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of silver to gain his support and
strengthen his own hold on the kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9946">20</sup> Menahem exacted this money from Israel.
Every wealthy man had to contribute fifty shekels<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9946g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of silver to be given to the king
of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and stayed in the land
no longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9947">21</sup> As for
the other events of Menahem’s reign, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9948">22</sup> Menahem rested
with his fathers. And Pekahiah his son succeeded him as king.</p>

became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9950">24</sup> Pekahiah did
evil in the eyes of the LORD. He did not turn away from the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9951">25</sup> One of his
chief officers, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him.
Taking fifty men of Gilead with him, he assassinated Pekahiah,
along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the royal palace at
Samaria. So Pekah killed Pekahiah and succeeded him as king.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9952">26</sup> The

became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9954">28</sup> He did evil in
the eyes of the LORD. He did not turn away from the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9955">29</sup> In the
time of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came
and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took
Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and
deported the people to Assyria. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9956">30</sup> Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired

the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9961">35</sup> The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense
there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9962">36</sup> As for
the other events of Jotham’s reign, and what he did, are they not
