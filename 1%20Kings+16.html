<h4>1 Kings 16</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9285">1</sup> Then
the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9286">2</sup> “I lifted you up
from the dust and made you leader of my people Israel, but you
walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin
and to provoke me to anger by their sins. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9287">3</sup> So I am about to consume Baasha and his
house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of
Nebat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9288">4</sup> Dogs will
eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and the birds of
the air will feed on those who die in the country.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9289">5</sup> As for
the other events of Baasha’s reign, what he did and his
achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9290">6</sup>
Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah
his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9291">7</sup>
Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of
Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done
in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger by the things he
did, and becoming like the house of Jeroboam—and also because he
destroyed it.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Elah King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9292">8</sup> In the
twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became
king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9293">9</sup> Zimri,
one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted
against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the
home of Arza, the man in charge of the palace at Tirzah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9294">10</sup> Zimri came in,
struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa
king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9295">11</sup> As
soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed
off Baasha’s whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether
relative or friend. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9296">12</sup> So Zimri destroyed the whole family of
Baasha, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken against
Baasha through the prophet Jehu— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9297">13</sup> because of all the sins Baasha and his
son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that
they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their
worthless idols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9298">14</sup> As for
the other events of Elah’s reign, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zimri King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9299">15</sup> In the
twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah
seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine
town. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9300">16</sup> When the
Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the
king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the
army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9301">17</sup> Then Omri and all the
Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to
Tirzah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9302">18</sup> When
Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the
royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9303">19</sup> because of the
sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD and
walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and
had caused Israel to commit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9304">20</sup> As for
the other events of Zimri’s reign, and the rebellion he carried
out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel?</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Omri King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9305">21</sup> Then the
people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni
son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9306">22</sup> But Omri’s
followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So
Tibni died and Omri became king.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9307">23</sup> In the
thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel,
and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9308">24</sup> He bought the hill of
Samaria from Shemer for two talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9308a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of
silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after
Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9309">25</sup> But
Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD and sinned more than all
those before him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9310">26</sup> He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam
son of Nebat and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit,
so that they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by
their worthless idols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9311">27</sup> As for
the other events of Omri’s reign, what he did and the things he
achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9312">28</sup> Omri rested with his fathers and was
buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ahab Becomes King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9313">29</sup> In the
thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became
king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two
years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9314">30</sup> Ahab son
of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those
before him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9315">31</sup> He
not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son
of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of
the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9316">32</sup> He set up an altar for
Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9317">33</sup> Ahab also made an Asherah
pole and did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger
than did all the kings of Israel before him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9318">34</sup> In
Ahab’s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its
foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up
its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with
the word of the LORD spoken by Joshua son of Nun.</p>
