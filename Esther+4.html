<h5 class="passage-header">Mordecai Persuades Esther to Help</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12764">1</sup> When
Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes,
put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing
loudly and bitterly. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12765">2</sup> But he went only as far as the king’s
gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12766">3</sup> In every
province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was
great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing.
Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12767">4</sup> When
Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she
was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead
of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12768">5</sup> Then Esther summoned
Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and
ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12769">6</sup> So
Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in
front of the king’s gate. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12770">7</sup> Mordecai told him everything that had
happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had
promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the
Jews. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12771">8</sup> He also
gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation,
which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it
to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king’s presence
to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12772">9</sup>
Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12773">10</sup> Then she
instructed him to say to Mordecai, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12774">11</sup> “All the king’s officials and the
people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who
approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the
king has but one law: that he be put to death. The only exception
to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare
his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to
the king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12775">12</sup> When
Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12776">13</sup> he sent back this answer: “Do not think
that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews
will escape. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12777">14</sup>
For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for
the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s
family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal
position for such a time as this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12778">15</sup> Then
Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12779">16</sup> “Go, gather together all the Jews who
are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days,
night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is
done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And
if I perish, I perish.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12780">17</sup> So
Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s
instructions.</p>
