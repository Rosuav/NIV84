<h4>1 Kings 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Wives</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9110">1</sup> King
Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s
daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9111">2</sup> They were from
nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not
intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts
after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9112">3</sup> He had seven
hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his
wives led him astray. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9113">4</sup> As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his
heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the
LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9114">5</sup> He followed
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9114a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> the detestable god of the
Ammonites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9115">6</sup> So
Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the
LORD completely, as David his father had done.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9116">7</sup> On a
hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the
detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the
Ammonites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9117">8</sup> He
did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and
offered sacrifices to their gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9118">9</sup> The
LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away
from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9119">10</sup> Although he had
forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the
LORD’s command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9120">11</sup>
So the LORD said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you
have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I
will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to
one of your subordinates. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9121">12</sup> Nevertheless, for the sake of David your
father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out
of the hand of your son. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9122">13</sup> Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom
from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my
servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Adversaries</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9123">14</sup> Then the
LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite,
from the royal line of Edom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9124">15</sup> Earlier when David was fighting with
Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the
dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9125">16</sup> Joab and all the Israelites stayed
there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9126">17</sup> But Hadad,
still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had
served his father. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9127">18</sup> They set out from Midian and went to
Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to
Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided
him with food.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9128">19</sup>
Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his
own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9129">20</sup> The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son
named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There
Genubath lived with Pharaoh’s own children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9130">21</sup> While
he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and
that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said
to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9131">22</sup> “What
have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?”
Pharaoh asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but do let me
go!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9132">23</sup> And
God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of
Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9133">24</sup> He gathered men
around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David
destroyed the forces<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9133b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of
Zobah; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took
control. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9134">25</sup> Rezon
was Israel’s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the
trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile
toward Israel.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9135">26</sup> Also,
Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of
Solomon’s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was
a widow named Zeruah.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9136">27</sup> Here
is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had
built the supporting terraces<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9136c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and had
filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9137">28</sup> Now Jeroboam
was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man
did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the
house of Joseph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9138">29</sup> About
that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the
prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two
of them were alone out in the country, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9139">30</sup> and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he
was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9140">31</sup> Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten
pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel,
says: ‘See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon’s hand
and give you ten tribes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9141">32</sup> But for the sake of my servant David and
the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel, he will have one tribe. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9142">33</sup> I will do this because they
have<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9142d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> forsaken me and worshiped
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the
Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked
in my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes
and laws as David, Solomon’s father, did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9143">34</sup> “‘But
I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand; I have
made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my
servant, whom I chose and who observed my commands and statutes.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9144">35</sup> I will take the
kingdom from his son’s hands and give you ten tribes. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9145">36</sup> I will give one tribe to
his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me
in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9146">37</sup> However, as for you, I
will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires;
you will be king over Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9147">38</sup> If you do whatever I command you and
walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my
statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you.
I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David
and will give Israel to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9148">39</sup> I will humble David’s descendants
because of this, but not forever.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9149">40</sup>
Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to
Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon’s death.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Death</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9150">41</sup> As for
the other events of Solomon’s reign—all he did and the wisdom he
displayed—are they not written in the book of the annals of
Solomon? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9151">42</sup>
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9152">43</sup> Then he rested
with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father.
And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
