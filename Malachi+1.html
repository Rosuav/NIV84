<h4>Malachi 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23091">1</sup> An
oracle: The word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.<sup class=

<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob Loved, Esau Hated</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23092">2</sup> “I have
loved you,” says the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you ask, ‘How have you loved us?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” the LORD says.
“Yet I have loved Jacob, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23093">3</sup> but Esau I have hated, and I have turned
his mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the
desert jackals.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23094">4</sup> Edom
may say, “Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the
ruins.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is what the LORD Almighty says: “They
may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked
Land, a people always under the wrath of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23095">5</sup> You will see it with your
own eyes and say, ‘Great is the LORD—even beyond the borders of
Israel!’</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Blemished Sacrifices</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23096">6</sup> “A son
honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father,
where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect
due me?” says the LORD Almighty. “It is you, O priests, who show
contempt for my name.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you ask, ‘How have we shown contempt for
your name?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23097">7</sup> “You
place defiled food on my altar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“By saying that the LORD’s table is
contemptible. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23098">8</sup>
When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When
you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try
offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would
he accept you?” says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23099">9</sup> “Now
implore God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your
hands, will he accept you?”—says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23100">10</sup> “Oh,
that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not
light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you,” says
the LORD Almighty, “and I will accept no offering from your hands.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23101">11</sup> My name will
be great among the nations, from the rising to the setting of the
sun. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to
my name, because my name will be great among the nations,” says the
LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23102">12</sup> “But
you profane it by saying of the Lord’s table, ‘It is defiled,’ and
of its food, ‘It is contemptible.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23103">13</sup> And you say, ‘What a burden!’ and you
sniff at it contemptuously,” says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When you bring injured, crippled or diseased
animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from
your hands?” says the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23104">14</sup> “Cursed is the cheat who has an
acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then
sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king,”
says the LORD Almighty, “and my name is to be feared among the
nations.</p>
