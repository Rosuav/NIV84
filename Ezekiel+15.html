<p><h4>Ezekiel 15</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jerusalem, A Useless Vine</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20756">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20757">2</sup> “Son of man, how is the wood of a vine better than that of a branch on any of the trees in the forest? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20758">3</sup> Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20759">4</sup> And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20760">5</sup> If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20761">6</sup> “Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20762">7</sup> I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20763">8</sup> I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD.” </p></div></body></html>
