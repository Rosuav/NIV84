<p><h4>Luke 18</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Persistent Widow</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25681">1</sup> Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25682">2</sup> He said: <font class='woj'>“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25683">3</sup> And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25684">4</sup> “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care about men,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25685">5</sup> yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually wear me out with her coming!’”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25686">6</sup> And the Lord said, <font class='woj'>“Listen to what the unjust judge says.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25687">7</sup> And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25688">8</sup> I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25689">9</sup> To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25690">10</sup> “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25691">11</sup> The Pharisee stood up and prayed about<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25691a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> himself: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25692">12</sup> I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25693">13</sup> “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25694">14</sup> “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Little Children and Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25695">15</sup> People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25696">16</sup> But Jesus called the children to him and said, <font class='woj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25697">17</sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Rich Ruler</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25698">18</sup> A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25699">19</sup> “Why do you call me good?”</font> Jesus answered. <font class='woj'>“No one is good—except God alone.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25700">20</sup> You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25700b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25701">21</sup> “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25702">22</sup> When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <font class='woj'>“You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25703">23</sup> When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25704">24</sup> Jesus looked at him and said, <font class='woj'>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25705">25</sup> Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25706">26</sup> Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25707">27</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“What is impossible with men is possible with God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25708">28</sup> Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25709">29</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25710">30</sup> will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Again Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25711">31</sup> Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, <font class='woj'>“We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25712">32</sup> He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25713">33</sup> On the third day he will rise again.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25714">34</sup> The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. <h5 class="passage-header">A Blind Beggar Receives His Sight</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25715">35</sup> As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25716">36</sup> When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25717">37</sup> They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25718">38</sup> He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25719">39</sup> Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25720">40</sup> Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25721">41</sup> “What do you want me to do for you?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lord, I want to see,” he replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25722">42</sup> Jesus said to him, <font class='woj'>“Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25723">43</sup> Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25691a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25691" title="Go to Luke 18:11">Luke 18:11</a> Or <i>to</i></li>
