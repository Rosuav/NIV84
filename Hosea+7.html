<p><h4>Hosea 7</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22180">1</sup> whenever I would heal Israel, <br />the sins of Ephraim are exposed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the crimes of Samaria revealed. <br />They practice deceit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thieves break into houses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bandits rob in the streets; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22181">2</sup> but they do not realize <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I remember all their evil deeds. <br />Their sins engulf them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are always before me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22182">3</sup> “They delight the king with their wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the princes with their lies. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22183">4</sup> They are all adulterers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning like an oven <br />whose fire the baker need not stir <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the kneading of the dough till it rises. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22184">5</sup> On the day of the festival of our king <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the princes become inflamed with wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he joins hands with the mockers. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22185">6</sup> Their hearts are like an oven; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they approach him with intrigue. <br />Their passion smolders all night; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22186">7</sup> All of them are hot as an oven; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they devour their rulers. <br />All their kings fall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and none of them calls on me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22187">8</sup> “Ephraim mixes with the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22188">9</sup> Foreigners sap his strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he does not realize it. <br />His hair is sprinkled with gray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he does not notice. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22189">10</sup> Israel’s arrogance testifies against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but despite all this <br />he does not return to the LORD his God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or search for him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22190">11</sup> “Ephraim is like a dove, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easily deceived and senseless— <br />now calling to Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turning to Assyria. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22191">12</sup> When they go, I will throw my net over them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pull them down like birds of the air. <br />When I hear them flocking together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will catch them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22192">13</sup> Woe to them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have strayed from me! <br />Destruction to them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have rebelled against me! <br />I long to redeem them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they speak lies against me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22193">14</sup> They do not cry out to me from their hearts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but wail upon their beds. <br />They gather together<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22193a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for grain and new wine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but turn away from me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22194">15</sup> I trained them and strengthened them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they plot evil against me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22195">16</sup> They do not turn to the Most High; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are like a faulty bow. <br />Their leaders will fall by the sword <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of their insolent words. <br />For this they will be ridiculed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of Egypt. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22193a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22193" title="Go to Hosea 7:14">Hosea 7:14</a> Most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint <i>They slash themselves</i></li>
