<h4>Luke 23</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25928">1</sup> Then
the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25929">2</sup> And they began to accuse
him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He
opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be
Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25929a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> a king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25930">3</sup> So
Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Yes, it is as you
say,”</font> Jesus replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25931">4</sup> Then
Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no
basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25932">5</sup> But
they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25932b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> by his teaching. He started in
Galilee and has come all the way here.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25933">6</sup> On
hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25934">7</sup> When he learned that Jesus
was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also
in Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25935">8</sup> When
Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he
had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he
hoped to see him perform some miracle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25936">9</sup> He plied him with many questions, but
Jesus gave him no answer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25937">10</sup> The chief priests and the teachers of
the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25938">11</sup> Then Herod and his
soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe,
they sent him back to Pilate. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25939">12</sup> That day Herod and Pilate became
friends—before this they had been enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25940">13</sup>
Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the
people, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25941">14</sup> and
said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the
people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have
found no basis for your charges against him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25942">15</sup> Neither has Herod, for he sent him
back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25943">16</sup> Therefore, I
will punish him and then release him.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25943c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25944">18</sup> With
one voice they cried out, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to
us!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25945">19</sup> (Barabbas
had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and
for murder.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25946">20</sup>
Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25947">21</sup> But they kept
shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25948">22</sup> For
the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man
committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty.
Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25949">23</sup> But
with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified,
and their shouts prevailed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25950">24</sup> So Pilate decided to grant their
demand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25951">25</sup> He
released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection
and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their
will.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Crucifixion</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25952">26</sup> As they
led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in
from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it
behind Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25953">27</sup>
A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned
and wailed for him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25954">28</sup> Jesus turned and said to them,
<font class='woj'>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep
for yourselves and for your children.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25955">29</sup> For the
time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women,
the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never
nursed!’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25956">30</sup> Then</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘they will say to the
mountains, “Fall on us!”</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and to the hills, “Cover
us!”’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25956d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25957">31</sup> For if men do these things when the
tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25958">32</sup> Two
other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be
executed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25959">33</sup> When
they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him,
along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25960">34</sup> Jesus said,
<font class='woj'>“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what
they are doing.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25960e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font>
And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25961">35</sup> The
people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They
said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of
God, the Chosen One.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25962">36</sup> The
soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25963">37</sup> and said, “If
you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25964">38</sup> There
was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE
JEWS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25965">39</sup> One
of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you
the Christ? Save yourself and us!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25966">40</sup> But
the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said,
“since you are under the same sentence? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25967">41</sup> We are punished justly, for we are
getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing
wrong.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25968">42</sup> Then
he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your
kingdom.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25968f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25969">43</sup> Jesus
answered him, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, today you
will be with me in paradise.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Death</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25970">44</sup> It was
now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land
until the ninth hour, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25971">45</sup> for the sun stopped shining. And the
curtain of the temple was torn in two. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25972">46</sup> Jesus called out with a loud voice,
<font class='woj'>“Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit.”</font> When he had said this, he breathed his last.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25973">47</sup> The
centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely
this was a righteous man.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25974">48</sup> When all the people who had gathered to
witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and
went away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25975">49</sup> But
all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him
from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Burial</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25976">50</sup> Now
there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and
upright man, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25977">51</sup>
who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from
the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of
God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25978">52</sup> Going to
Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25979">53</sup> Then he took it down, wrapped it in
linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which
no one had yet been laid. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25980">54</sup> It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath
was about to begin.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25981">55</sup> The
women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw
the tomb and how his body was laid in it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25982">56</sup> Then they went home and prepared spices
and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the
commandment.</p>
