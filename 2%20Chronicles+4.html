<h4>2 Chronicles 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Temple’s Furnishings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11248">1</sup> He made a
bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits
high.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11248a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11249">2</sup> He made the Sea of cast metal, circular
in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11249b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> high. It took a line of thirty
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11249c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to measure around it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11250">3</sup> Below the rim, figures of
bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11250d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> The
bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11251">4</sup> The
Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west,
three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of
them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11252">5</sup> It was a
handbreadth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11252e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> in thickness, and its rim
was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three
thousand baths.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11252f"
title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11253">6</sup> He
then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side
and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt
offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests
for washing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11254">7</sup> He
made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them
and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on
the north.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11255">8</sup> He
made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south
side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling
bowls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11256">9</sup> He
made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the
doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11257">10</sup> He placed the
Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11258">11</sup> He
also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Huram finished the work he had undertaken
for King Solomon in the temple of God:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11259">12</sup> the
two pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the
pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two sets of network decorating the two
bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11260">13</sup> the
four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of
pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals
on top of the pillars);</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11261">14</sup> the
stands with their basins;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11262">15</sup> the
Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11263">16</sup> the
pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King
Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11264">17</sup> The king had
them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth
and Zarethan.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11264g"
title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11265">18</sup> All these things that Solomon made
amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not
determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11266">19</sup>
Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God’s
temple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the golden altar;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tables on which was the bread of the
Presence;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11267">20</sup> the
lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the
inner sanctuary as prescribed;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11268">21</sup> the
gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11269">22</sup> the
pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and
the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy
Place and the doors of the main hall.</p>
