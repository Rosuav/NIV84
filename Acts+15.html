<h4>Acts 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Council at Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27432">1</sup> Some men
came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers:
“Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by
Moses, you cannot be saved.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27433">2</sup> This brought Paul and Barnabas into
sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were
appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem
to see the apostles and elders about this question. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27434">3</sup> The church sent them on
their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they
told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the
brothers very glad. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27435">4</sup> When they came to Jerusalem, they were
welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they
reported everything God had done through them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27436">5</sup> Then
some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees
stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required
to obey the law of Moses.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27437">6</sup> The
apostles and elders met to consider this question. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27438">7</sup> After much discussion,
Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time
ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from
my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27439">8</sup> God, who knows the heart,
showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them,
just as he did to us. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27440">9</sup> He made no distinction between us and
them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27441">10</sup> Now then, why do you try to test God
by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor
our fathers have been able to bear? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27442">11</sup> No! We believe it is through the grace
of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27443">12</sup> The
whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul
telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among
the Gentiles through them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27444">13</sup> When they finished, James spoke up:
“Brothers, listen to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27445">14</sup> Simon<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27445a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> has
described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from
the Gentiles a people for himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27446">15</sup> The words of the prophets are in
agreement with this, as it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27447">16</sup>
“‘After this I will return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rebuild David’s fallen tent.<br>
Its ruins I will rebuild,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will restore it,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27448">17</sup> that the
remnant of men may seek the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the Gentiles who bear my name,<br>
says the Lord, who does these things’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27448b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27449">18</sup> that
have been known for ages.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27449c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27450">19</sup> “It
is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for
the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27451">20</sup> Instead we should write to them,
telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual
immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27452">21</sup> For Moses has
been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in
the synagogues on every Sabbath.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Council’s Letter to Gentile
Believers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27453">22</sup> Then the
apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some
of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.
They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were
leaders among the brothers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27454">23</sup> With them they sent the following
letter:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apostles and elders, your brothers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and
Cilicia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27455">24</sup> We
have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and
disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27456">25</sup> So we all agreed to
choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas
and Paul— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27457">26</sup> men
who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27458">27</sup> Therefore we
are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are
writing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27459">28</sup> It
seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with
anything beyond the following requirements: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27460">29</sup> You are to abstain from food
sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals
and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these
things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27461">30</sup> The
men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the
church together and delivered the letter. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27462">31</sup> The people read it and were glad for
its encouraging message. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27463">32</sup> Judas and Silas, who themselves were
prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27464">33</sup> After spending
some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the
blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27464d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27465">35</sup> But Paul and Barnabas remained in
Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of
the Lord.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Disagreement Between Paul and
Barnabas</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27466">36</sup> Some
time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the
brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord
and see how they are doing.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27467">37</sup> Barnabas wanted to take John, also
called Mark, with them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27468">38</sup> but Paul did not think it wise to take
him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not
continued with them in the work. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27469">39</sup> They had such a sharp disagreement that
they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27470">40</sup> but Paul chose
Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27471">41</sup> He went
through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
