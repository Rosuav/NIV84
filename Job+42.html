<h4>Job 42</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Job</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13924">1</sup> Then Job replied to the LORD: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13925">2</sup> “I know that you can do all things; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no plan of yours can be thwarted. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13926">3</sup> You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things too wonderful for me to know. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13927">4</sup> “You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will question you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall answer me.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13928">5</sup> My ears had heard of you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now my eyes have seen you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13929">6</sup> Therefore I despise myself <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and repent in dust and ashes.” <h5 class="passage-header">Epilogue</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13930">7</sup> After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13931">8</sup> So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13932">9</sup> So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job’s prayer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13933">10</sup> After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13934">11</sup> All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13934a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and a gold ring. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13935">12</sup> The LORD blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13936">13</sup> And he also had seven sons and three daughters. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13937">14</sup> The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13938">15</sup> Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13939">16</sup> After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13940">17</sup> And so he died, old and full of years. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-13934a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-13934" title="Ir a Job 42:11">Job 42:11</a> Hebrew <i>him a kesitah</i>; a kesitah was a unit of money of unknown weight and value.</li>
