<h4>Genesis 21</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Isaac</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-515">1</sup> Now the
LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for
Sarah what he had promised. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-516">2</sup> Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to
Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-517">3</sup> Abraham gave the
name Isaac<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-517a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to the son Sarah bore him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-518">4</sup> When his son
Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-519">5</sup> Abraham was
a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-520">6</sup> Sarah
said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about
this will laugh with me.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-521">7</sup> And she added, “Who would have said to
Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son
in his old age.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-522">8</sup> The child
grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a
great feast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-523">9</sup> But
Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham
was mocking, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-524">10</sup> and
she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for
that slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my
son Isaac.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-525">11</sup> The
matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-526">12</sup> But God said to
him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant.
Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac
that your offspring<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-526b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> will be
reckoned. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-527">13</sup> I will
make the son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is
your offspring.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-528">14</sup> Early
the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and
gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her
off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of
Beersheba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-529">15</sup> When
the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the
bushes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-530">16</sup> Then she
went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she
thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there nearby,
she<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-530c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> began to sob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-531">17</sup> God
heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from
heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be
afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-532">18</sup> Lift the boy up and take
him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-533">19</sup> Then
God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and
filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-534">20</sup> God was
with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an
archer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-535">21</sup> While he
was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him
from Egypt.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Treaty at Beersheba</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-536">22</sup> At that
time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to
Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-537">23</sup> Now swear to me here before
God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my
descendants. Show to me and the country where you are living as an
alien the same kindness I have shown to you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-538">24</sup> Abraham
said, “I swear it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-539">25</sup> Then
Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that
Abimelech’s servants had seized. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-540">26</sup> But Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has
done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only
today.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-541">27</sup> So
Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and
the two men made a treaty. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-542">28</sup> Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from
the flock, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-543">29</sup> and
Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe
lambs you have set apart by themselves?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-544">30</sup> He
replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I
dug this well.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-545">31</sup> So that
place was called Beersheba,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-545d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> because
the two men swore an oath there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-546">32</sup> After
the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the
commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-547">33</sup> Abraham planted
a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of
the LORD, the Eternal God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-548">34</sup> And Abraham stayed in the land of the
Philistines for a long time.</p>
