<h4>Ezekiel 21</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Babylon, God’s Sword of Judgment</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20946">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20947">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against
Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against the
land of Israel <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20948">3</sup>
and say to her: ‘This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I
will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you both the
righteous and the wicked. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20949">4</sup> Because I am going to cut off the
righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against
everyone from south to north. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20950">5</sup> Then all people will know that I the
LORD have drawn my sword from its scabbard; it will not return
again.’
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20951">6</sup>
“Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart
and bitter grief. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20952">7</sup> And when they ask you, ‘Why are you
groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that is coming.
Every heart will melt and every hand go limp; every spirit will
become faint and every knee become as weak as water.’ It is coming!
It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20953">8</sup> The
word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20954">9</sup> “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is
what the Lord says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘A sword, a sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sharpened and polished—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20955">10</sup> sharpened for
the slaughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polished to flash like lightning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Shall we rejoice in the scepter of my son
Judah? The sword despises every such stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20956">11</sup> “‘The
sword is appointed to be polished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be grasped with the hand;<br>
it is sharpened and polished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made ready for the hand of the slayer.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20957">12</sup> Cry out and
wail, son of man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it is against my people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is against all the princes of Israel.<br>
They are thrown to the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with my people.<br>
Therefore beat your breast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20958">13</sup>
“‘Testing will surely come. And what if the scepter of Judah, which
the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Sovereign
LORD.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20959">14</sup> “So
then, son of man, prophesy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strike your hands together.<br>
Let the sword strike twice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even three times.<br>
It is a sword for slaughter—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sword for great slaughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closing in on them from every side.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20960">15</sup> So that hearts
may melt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fallen be many,<br>
I have stationed the sword for slaughter<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20960a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at all their gates.<br>
Oh! It is made to flash like lightning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is grasped for slaughter.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20961">16</sup> O sword, slash
to the right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then to the left,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherever your blade is turned.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20962">17</sup> I too will
strike my hands together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my wrath will subside.<br>
I the LORD have spoken.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20963">18</sup> The
word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20964">19</sup> “Son of man, mark out two roads for the
sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same
country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20965">20</sup> Mark out one
road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and
another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20966">21</sup> For the king of Babylon
will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two
roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will
consult his idols, he will examine the liver. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-20967">22</sup> Into his right hand will come the
lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to give
the command to slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering
rams against the gates, to build a ramp and to erect siege works.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20968">23</sup> It will seem
like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him, but he
will remind them of their guilt and take them captive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20969">24</sup>
“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you
people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion,
revealing your sins in all that you do—because you have done this,
you will be taken captive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20970">25</sup> “‘O
profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time
of punishment has reached its climax, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20971">26</sup> this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Take off the turban, remove the crown. It will not be as it was:
The lowly will be exalted and the exalted will be brought low.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20972">27</sup> A ruin! A
ruin! I will make it a ruin! It will not be restored until he comes
to whom it rightfully belongs; to him I will give it.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20973">28</sup> “And
you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD
says about the Ammonites and their insults:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘A sword, a sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drawn for the slaughter,<br>
polished to consume<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to flash like lightning!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20974">29</sup> Despite false
visions concerning you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lying divinations about you,<br>
it will be laid on the necks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the wicked who are to be slain,<br>
whose day has come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose time of punishment has reached its
climax.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20975">30</sup> Return the
sword to its scabbard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where you were created,<br>
in the land of your ancestry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will judge you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20976">31</sup> I will pour
out my wrath upon you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and breathe out my fiery anger against you;<br>
I will hand you over to brutal men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men skilled in destruction.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20977">32</sup> You will be
fuel for the fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your blood will be shed in your land,<br>
you will be remembered no more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I the LORD have spoken.’”</p>
