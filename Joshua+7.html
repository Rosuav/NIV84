<h4>Joshua 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Achan’s Sin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5978">1</sup> But the
Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted
things<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5978a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>; Achan son of Carmi, the son of
Zimri,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5978b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
Judah, took some of them. So the LORD’s anger burned against
Israel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5979">2</sup> Now
Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the
east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So
the men went up and spied out Ai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5980">3</sup> When
they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the people will have
to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and
do not weary all the people, for only a few men are there.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5981">4</sup> So about three
thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5982">5</sup> who killed about
thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate
as far as the stone quarries<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5982c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and
struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people
melted and became like water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5983">6</sup> Then
Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the
ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel
did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5984">7</sup> And Joshua said, “Ah,
Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the
Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us?
If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the
Jordan! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5985">8</sup> O Lord,
what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5986">9</sup> The Canaanites
and the other people of the country will hear about this and they
will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then
will you do for your own great name?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5987">10</sup> The
LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! What are you doing down on your
face? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5988">11</sup> Israel
has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them
to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have
stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own
possessions. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5989">12</sup>
That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they
turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to
destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy
whatever among you is devoted to destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5990">13</sup> “Go,
consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves in
preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says: That which is devoted is among you, O Israel. You
cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5991">14</sup> “‘In
the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the
LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan that the LORD
takes shall come forward family by family; and the family that the
LORD takes shall come forward man by man. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5992">15</sup> He who is caught with the devoted things
shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He
has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done a disgraceful
thing in Israel!’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5993">16</sup> Early
the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and
Judah was taken. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5994">17</sup> The clans of Judah came forward, and he
took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward
by families, and Zimri was taken. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5995">18</sup> Joshua had his family come forward man
by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah,
of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5996">19</sup> Then
Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5996d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> the God of Israel, and give him
the praise.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5996e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> Tell me what you have done;
do not hide it from me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5997">20</sup> Achan
replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of
Israel. This is what I have done: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5998">21</sup> When I saw in the plunder a beautiful
robe from Babylonia,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5998f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> two
hundred shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5998g"
title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of silver and a wedge of
gold weighing fifty shekels,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5998h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> I
coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my
tent, with the silver underneath.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5999">22</sup> So
Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was,
hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6000">23</sup> They took the things from
the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread
them out before the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6001">24</sup> Then
Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the
silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his
cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the
Valley of Achor. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6002">25</sup> Joshua said, “Why have you brought this
trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had
stoned the rest, they burned them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6003">26</sup> Over Achan they heaped up a large pile
of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his
fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of
Achor<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6003i" title=
"Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> ever since.</p>
