<h4>Exodus 1</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Israelites Oppressed</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1534">1</sup> These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1535">2</sup> Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1536">3</sup> Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1537">4</sup> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1538">5</sup> The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1538a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1539">6</sup> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1540">7</sup> but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1541">8</sup> Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1542">9</sup> “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become much too numerous for us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1543">10</sup> Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1544">11</sup> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1545">12</sup> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1546">13</sup> and worked them ruthlessly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1547">14</sup> They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1548">15</sup> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1549">16</sup> “When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1550">17</sup> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1551">18</sup> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1552">19</sup> The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1553">20</sup> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1554">21</sup> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1555">22</sup> Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every boy that is born<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1555b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-1538a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-1538" title="Ir a Exodus 1:5">Exodus 1:5</a> Masoretic Text (see also Gen. 46:27); Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint (see also Acts 7:14 and note at Gen. 46:27) <i>seventy-five</i></li>
