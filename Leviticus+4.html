<h5 class="passage-header">The Sin Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2797">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2798">2</sup>
“Say to the Israelites: ‘When anyone sins unintentionally and does
what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands—
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2799">3</sup> “‘If
the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must
bring to the LORD a young bull without defect as a sin offering for
the sin he has committed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2800">4</sup> He is to present the bull at the entrance
to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD. He is to lay his hand on
its head and slaughter it before the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2801">5</sup> Then the anointed priest shall take
some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the Tent of Meeting.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2802">6</sup> He is to dip his
finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before
the LORD, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2803">7</sup> The priest shall then put
some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense
that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. The rest of the
bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt
offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2804">8</sup> He shall remove all the fat
from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the inner
parts or is connected to them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2805">9</sup> both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with
the kidneys— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2806">10</sup>
just as the fat is removed from the ox<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2806a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> sacrificed as a fellowship
offering.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2806b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Then the priest shall burn them on
the altar of burnt offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2807">11</sup> But the hide of the bull and all its
flesh, as well as the head and legs, the inner parts and offal—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2808">12</sup> that is, all
the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a place
ceremonially clean, where the ashes are thrown, and burn it in a
wood fire on the ash heap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2809">13</sup> “‘If
the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is
forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands, even though the community
is unaware of the matter, they are guilty. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2810">14</sup> When they become aware of the sin
they committed, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin
offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2811">15</sup> The elders of the
community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the
LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2812">16</sup> Then the
anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood into the Tent
of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2813">17</sup> He
shall dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it before the LORD
seven times in front of the curtain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2814">18</sup> He is to put some of the blood on the
horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting.
The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of
burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2815">19</sup> He shall remove all the
fat from it and burn it on the altar, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2816">20</sup> and do with this bull just as he did
with the bull for the sin offering. In this way the priest will
make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2817">21</sup> Then he shall take the
bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This
is the sin offering for the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2818">22</sup> “‘When
a leader sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of
the commands of the LORD his God, he is guilty. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2819">23</sup> When he is made aware of
the sin he committed, he must bring as his offering a male goat
without defect. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2820">24</sup>
He is to lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the
place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It
is a sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2821">25</sup> Then the priest shall take some of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns
of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood
at the base of the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2822">26</sup> He shall burn all the fat on the altar
as he burned the fat of the fellowship offering. In this way the
priest will make atonement for the man’s sin, and he will be
forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2823">27</sup> “‘If a
member of the community sins unintentionally and does what is
forbidden in any of the LORD’s commands, he is guilty. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2824">28</sup> When he is made aware of
the sin he committed, he must bring as his offering for the sin he
committed a female goat without defect. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2825">29</sup> He is to lay his hand on the head of the
sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2826">30</sup> Then the priest
is to take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the
horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the
blood at the base of the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2827">31</sup> He shall remove all the fat, just as the
fat is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest shall
burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. In this way
the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be
forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2828">32</sup> “‘If
he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he is to bring a female
without defect. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2829">33</sup>
He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin
offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2830">34</sup> Then the priest
shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger
and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out
the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2831">35</sup> He shall remove all the
fat, just as the fat is removed from the lamb of the fellowship
offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar on top of the
offerings made to the LORD by fire. In this way the priest will
make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be
forgiven.</p>
