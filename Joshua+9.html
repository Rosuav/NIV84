<h4>Joshua 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Gibeonite Deception</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6039">1</sup> Now when
all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—those in
the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire
coast of the Great Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6039a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> as far
as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6040">2</sup> they came together to make war against
Joshua and Israel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6041">3</sup>
However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to
Jericho and Ai, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6042">4</sup>
they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys
were loaded<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6042b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> with worn-out sacks and old
wineskins, cracked and mended. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6043">5</sup> The men put worn and patched sandals on
their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply
was dry and moldy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6044">6</sup> Then they went to Joshua in the camp at
Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a
distant country; make a treaty with us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6045">7</sup> The men
of Israel said to the Hivites, “But perhaps you live near us. How
then can we make a treaty with you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6046">8</sup> “We are
your servants,” they said to Joshua.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do
you come from?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6047">9</sup> They
answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country
because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports
of him: all that he did in Egypt, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6048">10</sup> and all that he did to the two kings of
the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king
of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6049">11</sup> And our elders and all those living in
our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and
meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty
with us.”’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6050">12</sup> This
bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left
to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6051">13</sup> And these wineskins that
we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes
and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6052">14</sup> The
men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6053">15</sup> Then
Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the
leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6054">16</sup> Three
days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites
heard that they were neighbors, living near them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6055">17</sup> So the Israelites set out
and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah,
Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6056">18</sup> But the Israelites did not attack them,
because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by
the LORD, the God of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole assembly grumbled against the
leaders, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6057">19</sup> but
all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the LORD,
the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6058">20</sup> This is what we will do to
them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for
breaking the oath we swore to them.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6059">21</sup> They continued, “Let them live, but let
them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community.”
So the leaders’ promise to them was kept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6060">22</sup> Then
Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by
saying, ‘We live a long way from you,’ while actually you live near
us? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6061">23</sup> You are now
under a curse: You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and
water carriers for the house of my God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6062">24</sup> They
answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your
God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and
to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for
our lives because of you, and that is why we did this. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6063">25</sup> We are now in your hands.
Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6064">26</sup> So
Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6065">27</sup> That day he
made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the
community and for the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would
choose. And that is what they are to this day.</p>
