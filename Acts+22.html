<h4>Acts 22</h4>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27693">1</sup> “Brothers
and fathers, listen now to my defense.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27694">2</sup> When
they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very
quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Paul said: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27695">3</sup> “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia,
but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly
trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God
as any of you are today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27696">4</sup> I persecuted the followers of this Way
to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into
prison, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27697">5</sup> as also
the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained
letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to
bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27698">6</sup> “About
noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven
flashed around me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27699">7</sup> I fell to the ground and heard a voice
say to me, <font class='woj'>‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute
me?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27700">8</sup> “‘Who
are you, Lord?’ I asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ <font class='woj'>‘I am Jesus of Nazareth,
whom you are persecuting,’</font> he replied. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27701">9</sup> My companions saw the light, but they
did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27702">10</sup>
“‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ <font class='woj'>‘Get up,’</font> the Lord
said, <font class='woj'>‘and go into Damascus. There you will be
told all that you have been assigned to do.’</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27703">11</sup> My companions led me by
the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had
blinded me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27704">12</sup> “A
man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the
law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27705">13</sup> He stood beside me and
said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I
was able to see him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27706">14</sup> “Then
he said: ‘The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will
and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27707">15</sup> You will be
his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27708">16</sup> And now what are you
waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling
on his name.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27709">17</sup> “When
I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into
a trance <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27710">18</sup> and
saw the Lord speaking. <font class='woj'>‘Quick!’</font> he said to
me. <font class='woj'>‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because they
will not accept your testimony about me.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27711">19</sup>
“‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these men know that I went from one synagogue
to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27712">20</sup> And when the
blood of your martyr<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27712a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Stephen
was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes
of those who were killing him.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27713">21</sup> “Then
the Lord said to me, <font class='woj'>‘Go; I will send you far
away to the Gentiles.’</font> ”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul the Roman Citizen</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27714">22</sup> The
crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their
voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27715">23</sup> As
they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust
into the air, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27716">24</sup>
the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He
directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why
the people were shouting at him like this. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27717">25</sup> As they stretched him out to flog
him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for
you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27718">26</sup> When
the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it.
“What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman
citizen.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27719">27</sup> The
commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman
citizen?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I am,” he answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27720">28</sup> Then
the commander said, “I had to pay a big price for my
citizenship.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27721">29</sup> Those
who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander
himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman
citizen, in chains.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Before the Sanhedrin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27722">30</sup> The next
day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was
being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief
priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and
had him stand before them.
