<h4>1 Corinthians 7</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Marriage</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28473">1</sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28473a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28474">2</sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28475">3</sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28476">4</sup> The wife’s body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband’s body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28477">5</sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28478">6</sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28479">7</sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28480">8</sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28481">9</sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28482">10</sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28483">11</sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28484">12</sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28485">13</sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28486">14</sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28487">15</sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28488">16</sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28489">17</sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28490">18</sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28491">19</sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28492">20</sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28493">21</sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28494">22</sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord’s freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ’s slave. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28495">23</sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28496">24</sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28497">25</sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28498">26</sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28499">27</sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28500">28</sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28501">29</sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28502">30</sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28503">31</sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28504">32</sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28505">33</sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28506">34</sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28507">35</sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28508">36</sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28509">37</sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28510">38</sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28510b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28511">39</sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28512">40</sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28473a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28473" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</a> Or “<i>It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman</i>.”</li>

<li id="fen-NIV1984-28510b"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28510" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 7:38">1 Corinthians 7:38</a> Or <i> 36 If anyone thinks he is not treating his daughter properly, and if she is getting along in years, and he feels she ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. He should let her get married. 37 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind to keep the virgin unmarried—this man also does the right thing. 38 So then, he who gives his virgin in marriage does right, but he who does not give her in marriage does even better.</i></li>
