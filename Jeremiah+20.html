<h4>Jeremiah 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah and Pashhur</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19424">1</sup> When the
priest Pashhur son of Immer, the chief officer in the temple of the
LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19425">2</sup> he had Jeremiah the
prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin
at the LORD’s temple. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19426">3</sup> The next day, when Pashhur released him
from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD’s name for you is
not Pashhur, but Magor-Missabib.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19426a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19427">4</sup> For this is
what the LORD says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to
all your friends; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the
sword of their enemies. I will hand all Judah over to the king of
Babylon, who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the
sword. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19428">5</sup> I will
hand over to their enemies all the wealth of this city—all its
products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of
Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to
Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19429">6</sup> And
you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to
Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends
to whom you have prophesied lies.’”
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah’s Complaint</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19430">7</sup> O LORD,
you deceived<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19430b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> me, and I was
deceived<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19430c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you overpowered me and prevailed.<br>
I am ridiculed all day long;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone mocks me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19431">8</sup> Whenever I
speak, I cry out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proclaiming violence and destruction.<br>
So the word of the LORD has brought me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insult and reproach all day long.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19432">9</sup> But if I say,
“I will not mention him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or speak any more in his name,”<br>
his word is in my heart like a fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fire shut up in my bones.<br>
I am weary of holding it in;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, I cannot.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19433">10</sup> I hear many
whispering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Terror on every side!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report him! Let’s report him!”<br>
All my friends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are waiting for me to slip, saying,<br>
“Perhaps he will be deceived;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then we will prevail over him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take our revenge on him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19434">11</sup> But
the LORD is with me like a mighty warrior;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so my persecutors will stumble and not
prevail.<br>
They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their dishonor will never be forgotten.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19435">12</sup> O LORD
Almighty, you who examine the righteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and probe the heart and mind,<br>
let me see your vengeance upon them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to you I have committed my cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19436">13</sup> Sing
to the LORD!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give praise to the LORD!<br>
He rescues the life of the needy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19437">14</sup>
Cursed be the day I was born!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19438">15</sup> Cursed be the
man who brought my father the news,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who made him very glad, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A child is born to you—a son!”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19439">16</sup> May that man
be like the towns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD overthrew without pity.<br>
May he hear wailing in the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a battle cry at noon.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19440">17</sup> For he did not
kill me in the womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my mother as my grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her womb enlarged forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19441">18</sup> Why did I ever
come out of the womb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see trouble and sorrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to end my days in shame?</p>
