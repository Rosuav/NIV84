<h4>Joshua 6</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5951">1</sup> Now
Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went
out and no one came in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5952">2</sup> Then
the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your
hands, along with its king and its fighting men. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5953">3</sup> March around the city once
with all the armed men. Do this for six days. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5954">4</sup> Have seven priests carry trumpets of
rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around
the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5955">5</sup> When you hear
them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a
loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people
will go up, every man straight in.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5956">6</sup> So
Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the
ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry
trumpets in front of it.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5957">7</sup> And he ordered the people, “Advance!
March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark
of the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5958">8</sup> When
Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the
seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their
trumpets, and the ark of the LORD’s covenant followed them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5959">9</sup> The armed guard
marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear
guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5960">10</sup> But Joshua had
commanded the people, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your
voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then
shout!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5961">11</sup> So he
had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once.
Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5962">12</sup> Joshua
got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5963">13</sup> The
seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching
before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men
went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD,
while the trumpets kept sounding. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5964">14</sup> So on the second day they marched around
the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six
days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5965">15</sup> On the
seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city
seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they
circled the city seven times. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5966">16</sup> The seventh time around, when the
priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people,
“Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5967">17</sup> The city and all that is in it are to
be devoted<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5967a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to the LORD. Only Rahab the
prostitute<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5967b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and all who are with her in
her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5968">18</sup> But keep away
from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own
destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp
of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5969">19</sup> All the silver
and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD
and must go into his treasury.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5970">20</sup> When
the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the
trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so
every man charged straight in, and they took the city. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5971">21</sup> They devoted the city to
the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men
and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5972">22</sup> Joshua
said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the
prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in
accordance with your oath to her.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5973">23</sup> So the young men who had done the spying
went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers
and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and
put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5974">24</sup> Then
they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the
silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the
treasury of the LORD’s house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5975">25</sup> But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute,
with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the
men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the
Israelites to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5976">26</sup> At
that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the
LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At the cost of his firstborn son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will he lay its foundations;<br>
at the cost of his youngest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will he set up its gates.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5977">27</sup> So the
LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.</p>
