<h4>Esther 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Mordecai Honored</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12795">1</sup> That
night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the
chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12796">2</sup> It was
found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh,
two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had
conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12797">3</sup> “What
honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king
asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing has been done for him,” his
attendants answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12798">4</sup> The
king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the
outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging
Mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12799">5</sup> His
attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bring him in,” the king ordered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12800">6</sup> When
Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man
the king delights to honor?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there
that the king would rather honor than me?” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12801">7</sup> So he answered the king, “For the man
the king delights to honor, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12802">8</sup> have them bring a royal robe the king
has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest
placed on its head. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12803">9</sup> Then let the robe and horse be entrusted
to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the
king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city
streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man
the king delights to honor!’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12804">10</sup> “Go
at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and
do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the
king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12805">11</sup> So
Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on
horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This
is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12806">12</sup>
Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed
home, with his head covered in grief, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12807">13</sup> and told Zeresh his wife and all his
friends everything that had happened to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him,
“Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of
Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to
ruin!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12808">14</sup> While
they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and
hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.</p>
