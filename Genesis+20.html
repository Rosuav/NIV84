<h4>Genesis 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Abraham and Abimelech</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-497">1</sup> Now Abraham
moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between
Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-498">2</sup> and there Abraham said of
his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelech king of Gerar
sent for Sarah and took her.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-499">3</sup> But God
came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as
good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married
woman.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-500">4</sup> Now
Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you
destroy an innocent nation? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-501">5</sup> Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’
and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with
a clear conscience and clean hands.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-502">6</sup> Then God
said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear
conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is
why I did not let you touch her. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-503">7</sup> Now return the man’s wife, for he is a
prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do
not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will
die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-504">8</sup> Early
the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he
told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-505">9</sup> Then Abimelech
called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I
wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my
kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-506">10</sup> And Abimelech
asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-507">11</sup> Abraham
replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this
place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-508">12</sup> Besides, she really is my
sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she
became my wife. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-509">13</sup>
And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to
her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go,
say of me, “He is my brother.”’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-510">14</sup> Then
Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and
gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-511">15</sup> And Abimelech
said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-512">16</sup> To
Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-512a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of silver. This is to cover the
offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely
vindicated.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-513">17</sup> Then
Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his
slave girls so they could have children again, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-514">18</sup> for the LORD had closed up
every womb in Abimelech’s household because of Abraham’s wife
Sarah.</p>
