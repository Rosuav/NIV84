<h4>Isaiah 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Assyria, the LORD’s Instrument</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17809">1</sup> The LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17809a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17810">2</sup> And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17811">3</sup> Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17812">4</sup> Before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17813">5</sup> The LORD spoke to me again: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17814">6</sup> “Because this people has rejected <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gently flowing waters of Shiloah <br />and rejoices over Rezin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the son of Remaliah, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17815">7</sup> therefore the Lord is about to bring against them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mighty floodwaters of the River<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17815b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king of Assyria with all his pomp. <br />It will overflow all its channels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run over all its banks <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17816">8</sup> and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing through it and reaching up to the neck. <br />Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Immanuel<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17816c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17817">9</sup> Raise the war cry,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17817d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> you nations, and be shattered! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, all you distant lands. <br />Prepare for battle, and be shattered! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare for battle, and be shattered! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17818">10</sup> Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propose your plan, but it will not stand, <br />for God is with us.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17818e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">Fear God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17819">11</sup> The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17820">12</sup> “Do not call conspiracy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything that these people call conspiracy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17820f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup>; <br />do not fear what they fear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not dread it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17821">13</sup> The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is the one you are to fear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is the one you are to dread, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17822">14</sup> and he will be a sanctuary; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for both houses of Israel he will be <br />a stone that causes men to stumble <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a rock that makes them fall. <br />And for the people of Jerusalem he will be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a trap and a snare. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17823">15</sup> Many of them will stumble; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will fall and be broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be snared and captured.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17824">16</sup> Bind up the testimony <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and seal up the law among my disciples. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17825">17</sup> I will wait for the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. <br />I will put my trust in him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17826">18</sup> Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17827">19</sup> When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17828">20</sup> To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17829">21</sup> Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17830">22</sup> Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-17809a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-17809" title="Ir a Isaiah 8:1">Isaiah 8:1</a> <i>Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz</i> means <i>quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil</i>; also in verse 3.</li>
