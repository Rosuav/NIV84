<h4>Numbers 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Passover</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3967">1</sup> The LORD
spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the
second year after they came out of Egypt. He said, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3968">2</sup> “Have the Israelites
celebrate the Passover at the appointed time. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3969">3</sup> Celebrate it at the appointed time, at
twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with
all its rules and regulations.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3970">4</sup> So
Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3971">5</sup> and they did so in the
Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first
month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3972">6</sup> But
some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because
they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they
came to Moses and Aaron that same day <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3973">7</sup> and said to Moses, “We have become
unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from
presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the
appointed time?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3974">8</sup> Moses
answered them, “Wait until I find out what the LORD commands
concerning you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3975">9</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3976">10</sup> “Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you
or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away
on a journey, they may still celebrate the LORD’s Passover.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3977">11</sup> They are to
celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight.
They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter
herbs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3978">12</sup> They
must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones.
When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the
regulations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3979">13</sup>
But if a man who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails
to celebrate the Passover, that person must be cut off from his
people because he did not present the LORD’s offering at the
appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3980">14</sup> “‘An
alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover
must do so in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must
have the same regulations for the alien and the native-born.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Cloud Above the Tabernacle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3981">15</sup> On the
day the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony, was set up, the
cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the
tabernacle looked like fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3982">16</sup> That is how it continued to be; the
cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3983">17</sup> Whenever the cloud lifted
from above the Tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud
settled, the Israelites encamped. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3984">18</sup> At the LORD’s command the Israelites set
out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed
over the tabernacle, they remained in camp. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3985">19</sup> When the cloud remained over the
tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the LORD’s order and
did not set out. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3986">20</sup> Sometimes the cloud was over the
tabernacle only a few days; at the LORD’s command they would
encamp, and then at his command they would set out. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3987">21</sup> Sometimes the cloud stayed
only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning,
they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud
lifted, they set out. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3988">22</sup> Whether the cloud stayed over the
tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would
remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set
out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3989">23</sup> At the
LORD’s command they encamped, and at the LORD’s command they set
out. They obeyed the LORD’s order, in accordance with his command
through Moses.</div>
