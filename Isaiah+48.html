<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From now on I will tell you of new things, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of hidden things unknown to you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18622">7</sup> They are created now, and not long ago; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have not heard of them before today. <br />So you cannot say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Yes, I knew of them.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18623">8</sup> You have neither heard nor understood; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from of old your ear has not been open. <br />Well do I know how treacherous you are; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were called a rebel from birth. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18624">9</sup> For my own name’s sake I delay my wrath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so as not to cut you off. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18625">10</sup> See, I have refined you, though not as silver; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18626">11</sup> For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I let myself be defamed? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not yield my glory to another. <h5 class="passage-header">Israel Freed</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18627">12</sup> “Listen to me, O Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, whom I have called: <br />I am he; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the first and I am the last. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18628">13</sup> My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my right hand spread out the heavens; <br />when I summon them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all stand up together. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18629">14</sup> “Come together, all of you, and listen: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the idols has foretold these things? <br />The LORD’s chosen ally <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will carry out his purpose against Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his arm will be against the Babylonians.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18629a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18630">15</sup> I, even I, have spoken; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, I have called him. <br />I will bring him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will succeed in his mission. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18631">16</sup> “Come near me and listen to this: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the time it happens, I am there.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Sovereign LORD has sent me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his Spirit. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18632">17</sup> This is what the LORD says— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: <br />“I am the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who teaches you what is best for you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who directs you in the way you should go. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18633">18</sup> If only you had paid attention to my commands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your peace would have been like a river, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your righteousness like the waves of the sea. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18634">19</sup> Your descendants would have been like the sand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your children like its numberless grains; <br />their name would never be cut off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor destroyed from before me.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18635">20</sup> Leave Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flee from the Babylonians! <br />Announce this with shouts of joy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and proclaim it. <br />Send it out to the ends of the earth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, “The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18636">21</sup> They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he made water flow for them from the rock; <br />he split the rock <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and water gushed out. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18637">22</sup> “There is no peace,” says the LORD, “for the wicked.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18629a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18629" title="Ir a Isaiah 48:14">Isaiah 48:14</a> Or <i>Chaldeans</i>; also in verse 20</li>
