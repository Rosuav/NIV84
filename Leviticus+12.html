<h5 class="passage-header">Purification After Childbirth</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3046">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3047">2</sup>
“Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives
birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as
she is unclean during her monthly period. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3048">3</sup> On the eighth day the boy is to be
circumcised. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3049">4</sup>
Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her
bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary
until the days of her purification are over. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3050">5</sup> If she gives birth to a daughter, for
two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she
must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3051">6</sup> “‘When
the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is
to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a
year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for
a sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3052">7</sup>
He shall offer them before the LORD to make atonement for her, and
then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘These are the regulations for the woman who
gives birth to a boy or a girl. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3053">8</sup> If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to
bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and
the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make
atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”</p>
