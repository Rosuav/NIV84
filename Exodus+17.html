<h4>Exodus 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Water From the Rock</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1985">1</sup> The whole
Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from
place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but
there was no water for the people to drink. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1986">2</sup> So they quarreled with Moses and said,
“Give us water to drink.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me?
Why do you put the LORD to the test?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1987">3</sup> But the
people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against
Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us
and our children and livestock die of thirst?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1988">4</sup> Then
Moses cried out to the LORD, “What am I to do with these people?
They are almost ready to stone me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1989">5</sup> The
LORD answered Moses, “Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you
some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with
which you struck the Nile, and go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1990">6</sup> I will stand there before you by the rock
at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the
people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1991">7</sup> And he
called the place Massah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1991a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and
Meribah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1991b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> because the Israelites quarreled
and because they tested the LORD saying, “Is the LORD among us or
not?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Amalekites Defeated</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1992">8</sup> The
Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1993">9</sup> Moses said to
Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites.
Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in
my hands.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1994">10</sup> So
Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron
and Hur went to the top of the hill. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1995">11</sup> As long as Moses held up his hands, the
Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the
Amalekites were winning. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1996">12</sup> When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took
a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held
his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands
remained steady till sunset. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1997">13</sup> So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army
with the sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1998">14</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be
remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will
completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1999">15</sup> Moses
built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2000">16</sup> He said, “For hands were
lifted up to the throne of the LORD. The<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2000c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> LORD will be at war against the
Amalekites from generation to generation.”</p>
