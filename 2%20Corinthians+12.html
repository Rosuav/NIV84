<h4>2 Corinthians 12</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Vision and His Thorn</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29008">1</sup> I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29009">2</sup> I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29010">3</sup> And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29011">4</sup> was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29012">5</sup> I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29013">6</sup> Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29014">7</sup> To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29015">8</sup> Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29016">9</sup> But he said to me, <font class='woj'>“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</font> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29017">10</sup> That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. <h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Concern for the Corinthians</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29018">11</sup> I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29019">12</sup> The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29020">13</sup> How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29021">14</sup> Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29022">15</sup> So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29023">16</sup> Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29024">17</sup> Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29025">18</sup> I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29026">19</sup> Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29027">20</sup> For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29028">21</sup> I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged. </div></body></html>
