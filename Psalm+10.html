&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14043">1</sup> Why, O
LORD, do you stand far off?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14044">2</sup> In his
arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who are caught in the schemes he devises.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14045">3</sup> He boasts of
the cravings of his heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14046">4</sup> In his pride
the wicked does not seek him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in all his thoughts there is no room for God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14047">5</sup> His ways are
always prosperous;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is haughty and your laws are far from him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sneers at all his enemies.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14048">6</sup> He says to
himself, “Nothing will shake me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll always be happy and never have trouble.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14049">7</sup> His mouth is
full of curses and lies and threats;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble and evil are under his tongue.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14050">8</sup> He lies in wait
near the villages;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from ambush he murders the innocent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching in secret for his victims.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14051">9</sup> He lies in wait
like a lion in cover;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he lies in wait to catch the helpless;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he catches the helpless and drags them off in his
net.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14052">10</sup> His victims
are crushed, they collapse;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fall under his strength.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14053">11</sup> He says to
himself, “God has forgotten;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he covers his face and never sees.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14054">12</sup>
Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not forget the helpless.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14055">13</sup> Why does the
wicked man revile God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does he say to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He won’t call me to account”?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14056">14</sup> But you, O
God, do see trouble and grief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you consider it to take it in hand.<br>
The victim commits himself to you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are the helper of the fatherless.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14057">15</sup> Break the arm
of the wicked and evil man;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call him to account for his wickedness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that would not be found out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14058">16</sup> The
LORD is King for ever and ever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nations will perish from his land.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14059">17</sup> You hear, O
LORD, the desire of the afflicted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you encourage them, and you listen to their
cry,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14060">18</sup> defending the
fatherless and the oppressed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in order that man, who is of the earth, may
terrify no more.</p>
