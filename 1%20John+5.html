<h4>1 John 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Faith in the Son of God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30610">1</sup> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30611">2</sup> This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30612">3</sup> This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30613">4</sup> for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30614">5</sup> Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30615">6</sup> This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30616">7</sup> For there are three that testify: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30617">8</sup> the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30617a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30618">9</sup> We accept man’s testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30619">10</sup> Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30620">11</sup> And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30621">12</sup> He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. <h5 class="passage-header">Concluding Remarks</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30622">13</sup> I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30623">14</sup> This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30624">15</sup> And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30625">16</sup> If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that he should pray about that. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30626">17</sup> All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30627">18</sup> We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30628">19</sup> We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30629">20</sup> We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true—even in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30630">21</sup> Dear children, keep yourselves from idols. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30617a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30617" title="Ir a 1 John 5:8">1 John 5:8</a> Late manuscripts of the Vulgate <i>testify in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. 8 And there are three that testify on earth: the</i> (not found in any Greek manuscript before the fourteenth century)</li>
