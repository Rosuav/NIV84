<h4>Leviticus 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2919">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2920">2</sup> “Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2921">3</sup> and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2922">4</sup> Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2923">5</sup> Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2924">6</sup> Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2925">7</sup> He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also tied the ephod to him by its skillfully woven waistband; so it was fastened on him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2926">8</sup> He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2927">9</sup> Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred diadem, on the front of it, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2928">10</sup> Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2929">11</sup> He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2930">12</sup> He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2931">13</sup> Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and put headbands on them, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2932">14</sup> He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2933">15</sup> Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2934">16</sup> Moses also took all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2935">17</sup> But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its offal he burned up outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2936">18</sup> He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2937">19</sup> Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood against the altar on all sides. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2938">20</sup> He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2939">21</sup> He washed the inner parts and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2940">22</sup> He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2941">23</sup> Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2942">24</sup> Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled blood against the altar on all sides. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2943">25</sup> He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2944">26</sup> Then from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the LORD, he took a cake of bread, and one made with oil, and a wafer; he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2945">27</sup> He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2946">28</sup> Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2947">29</sup> He also took the breast—Moses’ share of the ordination ram—and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2948">30</sup> Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2949">31</sup> Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2949a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2950">32</sup> Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2951">33</sup> Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2952">34</sup> What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2953">35</sup> You must stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and do what the LORD requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2954">36</sup> So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded through Moses. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-2949a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-2949" title="Ir a Leviticus 8:31">Leviticus 8:31</a> Or <i>I was commanded:</i></li>
