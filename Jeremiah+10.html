<p><h4>Jeremiah 10</h4><h5 class="passage-header">God and Idols</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19203">1</sup> Hear what the LORD says to you, O house of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19204">2</sup> This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not learn the ways of the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or be terrified by signs in the sky, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though the nations are terrified by them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19205">3</sup> For the customs of the peoples are worthless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cut a tree out of the forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19206">4</sup> They adorn it with silver and gold; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fasten it with hammer and nails <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so it will not totter. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19207">5</sup> Like a scarecrow in a melon patch, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their idols cannot speak; <br />they must be carried <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they cannot walk. <br />Do not fear them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they can do no harm <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor can they do any good.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19208">6</sup> No one is like you, O LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are great, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your name is mighty in power. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19209">7</sup> Who should not revere you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O King of the nations? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your due. <br />Among all the wise men of the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in all their kingdoms, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no one like you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19210">8</sup> They are all senseless and foolish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are taught by worthless wooden idols. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19211">9</sup> Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gold from Uphaz. <br />What the craftsman and goldsmith have made <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is then dressed in blue and purple— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all made by skilled workers. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19212">10</sup> But the LORD is the true God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is the living God, the eternal King. <br />When he is angry, the earth trembles; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nations cannot endure his wrath. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19213">11</sup> “Tell them this: ‘These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19213a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19214">12</sup> But God made the earth by his power; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he founded the world by his wisdom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19215">13</sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. <br />He sends lightning with the rain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19216">14</sup> Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. <br />His images are a fraud; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have no breath in them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19217">15</sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when their judgment comes, they will perish. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19218">16</sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is the Maker of all things, <br />including Israel, the tribe of his inheritance— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty is his name. <h5 class="passage-header">Coming Destruction</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19219">17</sup> Gather up your belongings to leave the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live under siege. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19220">18</sup> For this is what the LORD says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At this time I will hurl out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who live in this land; <br />I will bring distress on them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that they may be captured.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19221">19</sup> Woe to me because of my injury! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wound is incurable! <br />Yet I said to myself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is my sickness, and I must endure it.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19222">20</sup> My tent is destroyed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all its ropes are snapped. <br />My sons are gone from me and are no more; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one is left now to pitch my tent <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or to set up my shelter. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19223">21</sup> The shepherds are senseless <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not inquire of the LORD; <br />so they do not prosper <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all their flock is scattered. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19224">22</sup> Listen! The report is coming— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great commotion from the land of the north! <br />It will make the towns of Judah desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a haunt of jackals. <h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah’s Prayer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19225">23</sup> I know, O LORD, that a man’s life is not his own; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not for man to direct his steps. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19226">24</sup> Correct me, LORD, but only with justice— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in your anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest you reduce me to nothing. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19227">25</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that do not acknowledge you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the peoples who do not call on your name. <br />For they have devoured Jacob; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have devoured him completely <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroyed his homeland. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-19213a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-19213" title="Go to Jeremiah 10:11">Jeremiah 10:11</a> The text of this verse is in Aramaic.</li>
