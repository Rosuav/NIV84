<h4>Isaiah 57</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18767">1</sup> The
righteous perish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one ponders it in his heart;<br>
devout men are taken away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one understands<br>
that the righteous are taken away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be spared from evil.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18768">2</sup> Those who walk
uprightly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into peace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they find rest as they lie in death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18769">3</sup> “But
you—come here, you sons of a sorceress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18770">4</sup> Whom are you
mocking?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At whom do you sneer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stick out your tongue?<br>
Are you not a brood of rebels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the offspring of liars?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18771">5</sup> You burn with
lust among the oaks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under every spreading tree;<br>
you sacrifice your children in the ravines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under the overhanging crags.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18772">6</sup> The idols among
the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they, they are your lot.<br>
Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and offered grain offerings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these things, should I
relent?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18773">7</sup> You have made
your bed on a high and lofty hill;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there you went up to offer your sacrifices.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18774">8</sup> Behind your
doors and your doorposts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have put your pagan symbols.<br>
Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you climbed into it and opened it wide;<br>
you made a pact with those whose beds you love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you looked on their nakedness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18775">9</sup> You went to
Molech<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18775a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> with olive oil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and increased your perfumes.<br>
You sent your ambassadors<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18775b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> far
away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you descended to the grave<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18775c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> itself!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18776">10</sup> You were
wearied by all your ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you would not say, ‘It is hopeless.’<br>
You found renewal of your strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so you did not faint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18777">11</sup> “Whom
have you so dreaded and feared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you have been false to me,<br>
and have neither remembered me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor pondered this in your hearts?<br>
Is it not because I have long been silent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you do not fear me?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18778">12</sup> I will expose
your righteousness and your works,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will not benefit you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18779">13</sup> When you cry
out for help,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let your collection of idols save you!<br>
The wind will carry all of them off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mere breath will blow them away.<br>
But the man who makes me his refuge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will inherit the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and possess my holy mountain.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Comfort for the Contrite</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18780">14</sup> And it
will be said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Build up, build up, prepare the road!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the obstacles out of the way of my
people.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18781">15</sup> For this is
what the high and lofty One says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who lives forever, whose name is holy:<br>
“I live in a high and holy place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also with him who is contrite and lowly in
spirit,<br>
to revive the spirit of the lowly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to revive the heart of the contrite.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18782">16</sup> I will not
accuse forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will I always be angry,<br>
for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the breath of man that I have created.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18783">17</sup> I was enraged
by his sinful greed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I punished him, and hid my face in anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet he kept on in his willful ways.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18784">18</sup> I have seen
his ways, but I will heal him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will guide him and restore comfort to him,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18785">19</sup> creating
praise on the lips of the mourners in Israel.<br>
Peace, peace, to those far and near,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. “And I will heal them.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18786">20</sup> But the wicked
are like the tossing sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cannot rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose waves cast up mire and mud.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18787">21</sup> “There is no
peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”</p>
