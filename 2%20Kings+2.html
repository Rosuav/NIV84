<h5 class="passage-header">Elijah Taken Up to Heaven</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9553">1</sup> When the
LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah
and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9554">2</sup> Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; the
LORD has sent me to Bethel.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD lives
and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to
Bethel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9555">3</sup> The
company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, “Do
you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you
today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I know,” Elisha replied, “but do not
speak of it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9556">4</sup> Then
Elijah said to him, “Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to
Jericho.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he replied, “As surely as the LORD lives
and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went to
Jericho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9557">5</sup> The
company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him,
“Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you
today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I know,” he replied, “but do not speak
of it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9558">6</sup> Then
Elijah said to him, “Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the
Jordan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he replied, “As surely as the LORD lives
and as you live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them walked
on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9559">7</sup> Fifty
men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance,
facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9560">8</sup> Elijah took his
cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided
to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on
dry ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9561">9</sup> When
they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do
for you before I am taken from you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let me inherit a double portion of your
spirit,” Elisha replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9562">10</sup> “You
have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said, “yet if you see me when
I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise not.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9563">11</sup> As
they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of
fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and
Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9564">12</sup> Elisha saw this and cried out, “My
father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha
saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them
apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9565">13</sup> He
picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and
stood on the bank of the Jordan. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9566">14</sup> Then he took the cloak that had fallen
from him and struck the water with it. “Where now is the LORD, the
God of Elijah?” he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to
the right and to the left, and he crossed over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9567">15</sup> The
company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The
spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him
and bowed to the ground before him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9568">16</sup> “Look,” they said, “we your servants
have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps
the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some
mountain or in some valley.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” Elisha replied, “do not send them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9569">17</sup> But
they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said,
“Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days
but did not find him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9570">18</sup> When they returned to Elisha, who was
staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to
go?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Healing of the Water</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9571">19</sup> The men
of the city said to Elisha, “Look, our lord, this town is well
situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is
unproductive.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9572">20</sup> “Bring
me a new bowl,” he said, “and put salt in it.” So they brought it
to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9573">21</sup> Then
he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, “This
is what the LORD says: ‘I have healed this water. Never again will
it cause death or make the land unproductive.’” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9574">22</sup> And the water has remained
wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Elisha Is Jeered</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9575">23</sup> From
there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road,
some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. “Go on up, you
baldhead!” they said. “Go on up, you baldhead!” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9576">24</sup> He turned around, looked
at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD.
Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the
youths. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9577">25</sup> And he
went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.</div>
