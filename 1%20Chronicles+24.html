<h4>1 Chronicles 24</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Divisions of Priests</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11017">1</sup> These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11018">2</sup> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11019">3</sup> With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11020">4</sup> A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than among Ithamar’s, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar’s descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar’s descendants. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11021">5</sup> They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11022">6</sup> The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11023">7</sup> The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second to Jedaiah, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11024">8</sup> the third to Harim, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourth to Seorim, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11025">9</sup> the fifth to Malkijah, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sixth to Mijamin, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11026">10</sup> the seventh to Hakkoz, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eighth to Abijah, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11027">11</sup> the ninth to Jeshua, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tenth to Shecaniah, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11028">12</sup> the eleventh to Eliashib, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twelfth to Jakim, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11029">13</sup> the thirteenth to Huppah, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11030">14</sup> the fifteenth to Bilgah, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sixteenth to Immer, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11031">15</sup> the seventeenth to Hezir, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eighteenth to Happizzez, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11032">16</sup> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twentieth to Jehezkel, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11033">17</sup> the twenty-first to Jakin, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twenty-second to Gamul, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11034">18</sup> the twenty-third to Delaiah <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11035">19</sup> This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Rest of the Levites</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11036">20</sup> As for the rest of the descendants of Levi: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sons of Amram: Shubael;
