<h4>2 Samuel 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Defeats the Ammonites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8242">1</sup> In the
course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun
succeeded him as king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8243">2</sup> David thought, “I will show kindness to
Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So
David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning
his father.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When David’s men came to the land of the
Ammonites, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8244">3</sup> the
Ammonite nobles said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think David is
honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy?
Hasn’t David sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out
and overthrow it?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8245">4</sup> So Hanun seized David’s men, shaved off
half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments in the middle at
the buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8246">5</sup> When
David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for
they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till
your beards have grown, and then come back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8247">6</sup> When
the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David’s
nostrils, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from
Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand
men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8248">7</sup> On
hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting
men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8249">8</sup> The
Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance
to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the
men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8250">9</sup> Joab
saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so
he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them
against the Arameans. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8251">10</sup> He put the rest of the men under the
command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the
Ammonites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8252">11</sup> Joab
said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come
to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I
will come to rescue you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8253">12</sup> Be strong and let us fight bravely for
our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good
in his sight.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8254">13</sup> Then
Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and
they fled before him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8255">14</sup> When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans
were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So
Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8256">15</sup> After
the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they
regrouped. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8257">16</sup>
Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the River<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8257a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>; they went to Helam, with Shobach
the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8258">17</sup> When
David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan
and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet
David and fought against him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8259">18</sup> But they fled before Israel, and David
killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of
their foot soldiers.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8259b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> He also
struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8260">19</sup> When all the
kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated
by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject
to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Arameans were afraid to help the
Ammonites anymore.</p>
