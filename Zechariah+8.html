<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD Promises to Bless
Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22978">1</sup> Again the
word of the LORD Almighty came to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22979">2</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: “I
am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22980">3</sup> This
is what the LORD says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in
Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the
mountain of the LORD Almighty will be called the Holy
Mountain.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22981">4</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe
old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with cane in
hand because of his age. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22982">5</sup> The city streets will be filled with
boys and girls playing there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22983">6</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the
remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to
me?” declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22984">7</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will save my people from the
countries of the east and the west. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22985">8</sup> I will bring them back to live in
Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and
righteous to them as their God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22986">9</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “You who now hear these words
spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid
for the house of the LORD Almighty, let your hands be strong so
that the temple may be built. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22987">10</sup> Before that time there were no wages
for man or beast. No one could go about his business safely because
of his enemy, for I had turned every man against his neighbor.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22988">11</sup> But now I will
not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,”
declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22989">12</sup> “The
seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will
produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give
all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22990">13</sup> As you have
been an object of cursing among the nations, O Judah and Israel, so
will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but
let your hands be strong.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22991">14</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring
disaster upon you and showed no pity when your fathers angered me,”
says the LORD Almighty, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22992">15</sup> “so now I have determined to do good
again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22993">16</sup> These are the things you
are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound
judgment in your courts; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22994">17</sup> do not plot evil against your neighbor,
and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22995">18</sup> Again
the word of the LORD Almighty came to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22996">19</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says:
“The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will
become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah.
Therefore love truth and peace.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22997">20</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants
of many cities will yet come, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22998">21</sup> and the inhabitants of one city will go
to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the LORD and seek
the LORD Almighty. I myself am going.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22999">22</sup> And many peoples and powerful nations
will come to Jerusalem to seek the LORD Almighty and to entreat
him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23000">23</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says: “In those days ten men from all
languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of
his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that
God is with you.’”</p>
