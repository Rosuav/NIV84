<p><h4>Ezekiel 18</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Soul Who Sins Will Die</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20851">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20852">2</sup> “What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The fathers eat sour grapes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the children’s teeth are set on edge’? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20853">3</sup> “As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20854">4</sup> For every living soul belongs to me, the father as well as the son—both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20855">5</sup> “Suppose there is a righteous man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does what is just and right. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20856">6</sup> He does not eat at the mountain shrines <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or look to the idols of the house of Israel. <br />He does not defile his neighbor’s wife <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lie with a woman during her period. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20857">7</sup> He does not oppress anyone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. <br />He does not commit robbery <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gives his food to the hungry <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provides clothing for the naked. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20858">8</sup> He does not lend at usury <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or take excessive interest.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20858a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />He withholds his hand from doing wrong <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and judges fairly between man and man. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20859">9</sup> He follows my decrees <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and faithfully keeps my laws. <br />That man is righteous; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will surely live, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Sovereign LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20860">10</sup> “Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20860b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20861">11</sup> (though the father has done none of them): <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He eats at the mountain shrines. <br />He defiles his neighbor’s wife. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20862">12</sup> He oppresses the poor and needy. <br />He commits robbery. <br />He does not return what he took in pledge. <br />He looks to the idols. <br />He does detestable things. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20863">13</sup> He lends at usury and takes excessive interest. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20864">14</sup> “But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20865">15</sup> “He does not eat at the mountain shrines <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or look to the idols of the house of Israel. <br />He does not defile his neighbor’s wife. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20866">16</sup> He does not oppress anyone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or require a pledge for a loan. <br />He does not commit robbery <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gives his food to the hungry <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provides clothing for the naked. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20867">17</sup> He withholds his hand from sin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20867c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and takes no usury or excessive interest. <br />He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20868">18</sup> But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20869">19</sup> “Yet you ask, ‘Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20870">20</sup> The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20871">21</sup> “But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20872">22</sup> None of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20873">23</sup> Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20874">24</sup> “But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked man does, will he live? None of the righteous things he has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has committed, he will die. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20875">25</sup> “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear, O house of Israel: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20876">26</sup> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it; because of the sin he has committed he will die. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20877">27</sup> But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20878">28</sup> Because he considers all the offenses he has committed and turns away from them, he will surely live; he will not die. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20879">29</sup> Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are my ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20880">30</sup> “Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20881">31</sup> Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20882">32</sup> For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live! </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20858a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20858" title="Go to Ezekiel 18:8">Ezekiel 18:8</a> Or <i>take interest</i>; similarly in verses 13 and 17</li>
