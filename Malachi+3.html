<h4>Malachi 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23122">1</sup> “See,
I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then
suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the
messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the
LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23123">2</sup> But
who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he
appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s
soap. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23124">3</sup> He will
sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites
and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will have men
who will bring offerings in righteousness, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23125">4</sup> and the offerings of Judah and
Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as in days gone by, as in
former years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23126">5</sup> “So I
will come near to you for judgment. I will be quick to testify
against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who
defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the
fatherless, and deprive aliens of justice, but do not fear me,”
says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Robbing God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23127">6</sup> “I the
LORD do not change. So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not
destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23128">7</sup> Ever
since the time of your forefathers you have turned away from my
decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to
you,” says the LORD Almighty.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you ask, ‘How are we to return?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23129">8</sup> “Will
a man rob God? Yet you rob me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you ask, ‘How do we rob you?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In tithes and offerings. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23130">9</sup> You are under a curse—the
whole nation of you—because you are robbing me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23131">10</sup> Bring the whole tithe
into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in
this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open
the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you
will not have room enough for it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23132">11</sup> I will prevent pests from devouring
your crops, and the vines in your fields will not cast their
fruit,” says the LORD Almighty. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23133">12</sup> “Then all the nations will call you
blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,” says the LORD
Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23134">13</sup> “You
have said harsh things against me,” says the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yet you ask, ‘What have we said against
you?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23135">14</sup> “You
have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What did we gain by carrying
out his requirements and going about like mourners before the LORD
Almighty? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23136">15</sup> But
now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly the evildoers prosper,
and even those who challenge God escape.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23137">16</sup> Then
those who feared the LORD talked with each other, and the LORD
listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his
presence concerning those who feared the LORD and honored his
name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23138">17</sup> “They
will be mine,” says the LORD Almighty, “in the day when I make up
my treasured possession.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23138a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> I will
spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23139">18</sup> And you
will again see the distinction between the righteous and the
wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.</p>
