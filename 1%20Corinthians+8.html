<h4>1 Corinthians 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Food Sacrificed to Idols</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28513">1</sup> Now about
food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess
knowledge.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28513a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Knowledge puffs up, but love
builds up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28514">2</sup> The
man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to
know. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28515">3</sup> But the
man who loves God is known by God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28516">4</sup> So
then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol
is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28517">5</sup> For even if
there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed
there are many “gods” and many “lords”), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28518">6</sup> yet for us there is but one God, the
Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there
is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and
through whom we live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28519">7</sup> But
not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to
idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been
sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is
defiled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28520">8</sup> But
food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not
eat, and no better if we do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28521">9</sup> Be
careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become
a stumbling block to the weak. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28522">10</sup> For if anyone with a weak conscience
sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, won’t
he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28523">11</sup> So this weak
brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28524">12</sup> When you sin
against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience,
you sin against Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28525">13</sup> Therefore, if what I eat causes my
brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I
will not cause him to fall.</p>
