<h4>Isaiah 31</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Woe to Those Who Rely on Egypt</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18252">1</sup> Woe to
those who go down to Egypt for help,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who rely on horses,<br>
who trust in the multitude of their chariots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the great strength of their horsemen,<br>
but do not look to the Holy One of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or seek help from the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18253">2</sup> Yet he too is
wise and can bring disaster;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not take back his words.<br>
He will rise up against the house of the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against those who help evildoers.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18254">3</sup> But the
Egyptians are men and not God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their horses are flesh and not spirit.<br>
When the LORD stretches out his hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who helps will stumble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who is helped will fall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both will perish together.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18255">4</sup> This
is what the LORD says to me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As a lion growls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great lion over his prey—<br>
and though a whole band of shepherds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is called together against him,<br>
he is not frightened by their shouts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or disturbed by their clamor—<br>
so the LORD Almighty will come down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do battle on Mount Zion and on its
heights.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18256">5</sup> Like birds
hovering overhead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty will shield Jerusalem;<br>
he will shield it and deliver it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will ‘pass over’ it and will rescue it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18257">6</sup> Return
to him you have so greatly revolted against, O Israelites.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18258">7</sup> For in that day
every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your
sinful hands have made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18259">8</sup>
“Assyria will fall by a sword that is not of man;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sword, not of mortals, will devour them.<br>
They will flee before the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their young men will be put to forced
labor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18260">9</sup> Their
stronghold will fall because of terror;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at sight of the battle standard their commanders
will panic,”<br>
declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose fire is in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose furnace is in Jerusalem.</p>
