<h4>Job 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Job</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13053">1</sup> Then Job replied: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13054">2</sup> “Indeed, I know that this is true. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can a mortal be righteous before God? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13055">3</sup> Though one wished to dispute with him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he could not answer him one time out of a thousand. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13056">4</sup> His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has resisted him and come out unscathed? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13057">5</sup> He moves mountains without their knowing it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and overturns them in his anger. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13058">6</sup> He shakes the earth from its place <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes its pillars tremble. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13059">7</sup> He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he seals off the light of the stars. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13060">8</sup> He alone stretches out the heavens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and treads on the waves of the sea. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13061">9</sup> He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13062">10</sup> He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miracles that cannot be counted. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13063">11</sup> When he passes me, I cannot see him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he goes by, I cannot perceive him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13064">12</sup> If he snatches away, who can stop him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13065">13</sup> God does not restrain his anger; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13066">14</sup> “How then can I dispute with him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I find words to argue with him? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13067">15</sup> Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could only plead with my Judge for mercy. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13068">16</sup> Even if I summoned him and he responded, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe he would give me a hearing. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13069">17</sup> He would crush me with a storm <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and multiply my wounds for no reason. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13070">18</sup> He would not let me regain my breath <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but would overwhelm me with misery. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13071">19</sup> If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13071a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13072">20</sup> Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13073">21</sup> “Although I am blameless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no concern for myself; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I despise my own life. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13074">22</sup> It is all the same; that is why I say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13075">23</sup> When a scourge brings sudden death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he mocks the despair of the innocent. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13076">24</sup> When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he blindfolds its judges. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not he, then who is it? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13077">25</sup> “My days are swifter than a runner; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fly away without a glimpse of joy. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13078">26</sup> They skim past like boats of papyrus, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like eagles swooping down on their prey. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13079">27</sup> If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will change my expression, and smile,’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13080">28</sup> I still dread all my sufferings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I know you will not hold me innocent. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13081">29</sup> Since I am already found guilty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why should I struggle in vain? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13082">30</sup> Even if I washed myself with soap<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13082b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hands with washing soda, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13083">31</sup> you would plunge me into a slime pit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that even my clothes would detest me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13084">32</sup> “He is not a man like me that I might answer him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we might confront each other in court. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13085">33</sup> If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to lay his hand upon us both, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13086">34</sup> someone to remove God’s rod from me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that his terror would frighten me no more. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13087">35</sup> Then I would speak up without fear of him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but as it now stands with me, I cannot. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-13071a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-13071" title="Ir a Job 9:19">Job 9:19</a> See Septuagint; Hebrew <i>me.</i></li>
