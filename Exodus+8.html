<h4>Exodus 8</h4>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1712">1</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what
the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1713">2</sup> If you refuse to
let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1714">3</sup> The Nile will
teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your
bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on
your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1715">4</sup> The frogs will go up on you
and your people and all your officials.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1716">5</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with
your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs
come up on the land of Egypt.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1717">6</sup> So
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the
frogs came up and covered the land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1718">7</sup> But the magicians did the same things by
their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of
Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1719">8</sup> Pharaoh
summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the
frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to
offer sacrifices to the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1720">9</sup> Moses
said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for
me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and
your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain
in the Nile.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1721">10</sup>
“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that
you may know there is no one like the LORD our God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1722">11</sup> The frogs will leave you
and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain
only in the Nile.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1723">12</sup> After
Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the
frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1724">13</sup> And the LORD did what Moses asked. The
frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1725">14</sup> They were piled
into heaps, and the land reeked of them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1726">15</sup> But when Pharaoh saw that there was
relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and
Aaron, just as the LORD had said.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plague of Gnats</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1727">16</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike
the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust
will become gnats.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1728">17</sup> They did this, and when Aaron stretched
out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground,
gnats came upon men and animals. All the dust throughout the land
of Egypt became gnats. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1729">18</sup> But when the magicians tried to produce
gnats by their secret arts, they could not. And the gnats were on
men and animals.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1730">19</sup> The
magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But
Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD
had said.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plague of Flies</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1731">20</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront
Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him, ‘This is what the
LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1732">21</sup> If you do not
let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your
officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the
Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground where they
are.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1733">22</sup> “‘But
on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where
my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will
know that I, the LORD, am in this land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1734">23</sup> I will make a distinction<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1734a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> between my people and your people.
This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1735">24</sup> And
the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s
palace and into the houses of his officials, and throughout Egypt
the land was ruined by the flies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1736">25</sup> Then
Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your
God here in the land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1737">26</sup> But
Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the
LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer
sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone
us? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1738">27</sup> We must
take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the
LORD our God, as he commands us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1739">28</sup>
Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD
your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for
me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1740">29</sup> Moses
answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and
tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his
people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by
not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1741">30</sup> Then
Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1742">31</sup> and the LORD did what Moses asked:
The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly
remained. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1743">32</sup> But
this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the
people go.</p>
