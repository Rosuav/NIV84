<h4>James 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Favoritism Forbidden</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30279">1</sup> My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don’t show favoritism. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30280">2</sup> Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30281">3</sup> If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30282">4</sup> have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30283">5</sup> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30284">6</sup> But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30285">7</sup> Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30286">8</sup> If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30286a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> you are doing right. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30287">9</sup> But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30288">10</sup> For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30289">11</sup> For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30289b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> also said, “Do not murder.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30289c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30290">12</sup> Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30291">13</sup> because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment! <h5 class="passage-header">Faith and Deeds</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30292">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30293">15</sup> Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30294">16</sup> If one of you says to him, “Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30295">17</sup> In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30296">18</sup> But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30297">19</sup> You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30298">20</sup> You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30298d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30299">21</sup> Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30300">22</sup> You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30301">23</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30301e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and he was called God’s friend. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30302">24</sup> You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30303">25</sup> In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30304">26</sup> As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30286a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30286" title="Go to James 2:8">James 2:8</a> Lev. 19:18</li>
