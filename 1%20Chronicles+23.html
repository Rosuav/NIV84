<h4>1 Chronicles 23</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Levites</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10985">1</sup> When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10986">2</sup> He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10987">3</sup> The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10988">4</sup> David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to supervise the work of the temple of the LORD and six thousand are to be officials and judges. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10989">5</sup> Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10990">6</sup> David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. <h5 class="passage-header">Gershonites</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10991">7</sup> Belonging to the Gershonites: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladan and Shimei. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10992">8</sup> The sons of Ladan: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel—three in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10993">9</sup> The sons of Shimei: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran—three in all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the heads of the families of Ladan. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10994">10</sup> And the sons of Shimei: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jahath, Ziza,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10994a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Jeush and Beriah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the sons of Shimei—four in all. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10995">11</sup> Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment. <h5 class="passage-header">Kohathites</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10996">12</sup> The sons of Kohath: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10997">13</sup> The sons of Amram: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron and Moses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10998">14</sup> The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10999">15</sup> The sons of Moses: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gershom and Eliezer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11000">16</sup> The descendants of Gershom: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shubael was the first. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11001">17</sup> The descendants of Eliezer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabiah was the first. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11002">18</sup> The sons of Izhar: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelomith was the first. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11003">19</sup> The sons of Hebron: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11004">20</sup> The sons of Uzziel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micah the first and Isshiah the second. <h5 class="passage-header">Merarites</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11005">21</sup> The sons of Merari: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahli and Mushi. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of Mahli: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleazar and Kish. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11006">22</sup> Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11007">23</sup> The sons of Mushi: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth—three in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11008">24</sup> These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11009">25</sup> For David had said, “Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11010">26</sup> the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11011">27</sup> According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11012">28</sup> The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11013">29</sup> They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11014">30</sup> They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11015">31</sup> and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11016">32</sup> And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-10994a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-10994" title="Ir a 1 Chronicles 23:10">1 Chronicles 23:10</a> One Hebrew manuscript, Septuagint and Vulgate (see also verse 11); most Hebrew manuscripts <i>Zina</i></li>
