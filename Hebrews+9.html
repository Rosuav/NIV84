<h4>Hebrews 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Worship in the Earthly Tabernacle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30091">1</sup> Now the
first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly
sanctuary. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30092">2</sup> A
tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the
table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30093">3</sup> Behind the
second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30094">4</sup> which had the golden altar
of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark
contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and
the stone tablets of the covenant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30095">5</sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the
Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30095a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> But we cannot discuss these things
in detail now.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30096">6</sup> When
everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered
regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30097">7</sup> But only the
high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and
never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins
the people had committed in ignorance. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30098">8</sup> The Holy Spirit was showing by this that
the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long
as the first tabernacle was still standing. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30099">9</sup> This is an illustration for the
present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being
offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30100">10</sup> They are only
a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external
regulations applying until the time of the new order.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Blood of Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30101">11</sup> When
Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already
here,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30101b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> he went through the greater and
more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a
part of this creation. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30102">12</sup> He did not enter by means of the blood
of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for
all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30103">13</sup> The blood of
goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who
are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly
clean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30104">14</sup> How
much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences
from acts that lead to death,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30104c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> so
that we may serve the living God!
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30105">15</sup> For
this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those
who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now
that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins
committed under the first covenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30106">16</sup> In
the case of a will,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30106d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> it is
necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30107">17</sup> because a will is in
force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the
one who made it is living. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30108">18</sup> This is why even the first covenant was
not put into effect without blood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30109">19</sup> When Moses had proclaimed every
commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of
calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop,
and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30110">20</sup> He said, “This is the blood of the
covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30110e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30111">21</sup> In the same way, he sprinkled with the
blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30112">22</sup> In fact, the
law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30113">23</sup> It
was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be
purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves
with better sacrifices than these. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30114">24</sup> For Christ did not enter a man-made
sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven
itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30115">25</sup> Nor did he enter heaven
to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters
the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30116">26</sup> Then Christ
would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the
world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages
to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30117">27</sup> Just as man is destined
to die once, and after that to face judgment, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30118">28</sup> so Christ was sacrificed once to
take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second
time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are
waiting for him.</p>
