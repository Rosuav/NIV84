<h4>Joshua 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Allotment for Ephraim and Manasseh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6267">1</sup> The
allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6267a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> east of the waters of Jericho, and
went up from there through the desert into the hill country of
Bethel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6268">2</sup> It went
on from Bethel (that is, Luz),<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6268b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> crossed
over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6269">3</sup> descended westward to the
territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth
Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6270">4</sup> So
Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their
inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6271">5</sup> This
was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundary of their inheritance went from
Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-6272">6</sup> and continued to the sea. From
Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
passing by it to Janoah on the east. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6273">7</sup> Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth
and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6274">8</sup> From Tappuah the border
went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the
inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6275">9</sup> It also included
all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the
Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6276">10</sup> They
did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the
Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do
forced labor.</p>
