<p><h4>Luke 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Calling of the First Disciples</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25101">1</sup> One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25101a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25102">2</sup> he saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25103">3</sup> He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25104">4</sup> When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <font class='woj'>“Put out into deep water, and let down<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25104b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the nets for a catch.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25105">5</sup> Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25106">6</sup> When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25107">7</sup> So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25108">8</sup> When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25109">9</sup> For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25110">10</sup> and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jesus said to Simon, <font class='woj'>“Don’t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25111">11</sup> So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Man With Leprosy</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25112">12</sup> While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25112c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25113">13</sup> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <font class='woj'>“I am willing,”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“Be clean!”</font> And immediately the leprosy left him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25114">14</sup> Then Jesus ordered him, <font class='woj'>“Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25115">15</sup> Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25116">16</sup> But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25117">17</sup> One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25118">18</sup> Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25119">19</sup> When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25120">20</sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he said, <font class='woj'>“Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25121">21</sup> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25122">22</sup> Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, <font class='woj'>“Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25123">23</sup> Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25124">24</sup> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins…”</font> He said to the paralyzed man, <font class='woj'>“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25125">25</sup> Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25126">26</sup> Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Calling of Levi</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25127">27</sup> After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. <font class='woj'>“Follow me,”</font> Jesus said to him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25128">28</sup> and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25129">29</sup> Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25130">30</sup> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25131">31</sup> Jesus answered them, <font class='woj'>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25132">32</sup> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25133">33</sup> They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25134">34</sup> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25135">35</sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25136">36</sup> He told them this parable: <font class='woj'>“No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25137">37</sup> And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25138">38</sup> No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25139">39</sup> And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25101a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25101" title="Go to Luke 5:1">Luke 5:1</a> That is, Sea of Galilee</li>
