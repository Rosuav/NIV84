<h4>Galatians 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29043">1</sup> Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29044">2</sup> and all the brothers with me, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the churches in Galatia: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29045">3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29046">4</sup> who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29047">5</sup> to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <h5 class="passage-header">No Other Gospel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29048">6</sup> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29049">7</sup> which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29050">8</sup> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29051">9</sup> As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29052">10</sup> Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. <h5 class="passage-header">Paul Called by God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29053">11</sup> I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29054">12</sup> I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29055">13</sup> For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29056">14</sup> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29057">15</sup> But when God, who set me apart from birth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29057a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and called me by his grace, was pleased <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29058">16</sup> to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29059">17</sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29060">18</sup> Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29060b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and stayed with him fifteen days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29061">19</sup> I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29062">20</sup> I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29063">21</sup> Later I went to Syria and Cilicia. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29064">22</sup> I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29065">23</sup> They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29066">24</sup> And they praised God because of me. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29057a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29057" title="Ir a Galatians 1:15">Galatians 1:15</a> Or <i>from my mother’s womb</i></li>
