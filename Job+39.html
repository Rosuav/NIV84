<h4>Job 39</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13836">1</sup> “Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13837">2</sup> Do you count the months till they bear? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know the time they give birth? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13838">3</sup> They crouch down and bring forth their young; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their labor pains are ended. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13839">4</sup> Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they leave and do not return. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13840">5</sup> “Who let the wild donkey go free? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who untied his ropes? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13841">6</sup> I gave him the wasteland as his home, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the salt flats as his habitat. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13842">7</sup> He laughs at the commotion in the town; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not hear a driver’s shout. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13843">8</sup> He ranges the hills for his pasture <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and searches for any green thing. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13844">9</sup> “Will the wild ox consent to serve you? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he stay by your manger at night? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13845">10</sup> Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he till the valleys behind you? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13846">11</sup> Will you rely on him for his great strength? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you leave your heavy work to him? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13847">12</sup> Can you trust him to bring in your grain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gather it to your threshing floor? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13848">13</sup> “The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13849">14</sup> She lays her eggs on the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lets them warm in the sand, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13850">15</sup> unmindful that a foot may crush them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that some wild animal may trample them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13851">16</sup> She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she cares not that her labor was in vain, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13852">17</sup> for God did not endow her with wisdom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or give her a share of good sense. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13853">18</sup> Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she laughs at horse and rider. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13854">19</sup> “Do you give the horse his strength <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or clothe his neck with a flowing mane? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13855">20</sup> Do you make him leap like a locust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;striking terror with his proud snorting? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13856">21</sup> He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and charges into the fray. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13857">22</sup> He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not shy away from the sword. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13858">23</sup> The quiver rattles against his side, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with the flashing spear and lance. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13859">24</sup> In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13860">25</sup> At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, ‘Aha!’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He catches the scent of battle from afar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shout of commanders and the battle cry. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13861">26</sup> “Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spread his wings toward the south? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13862">27</sup> Does the eagle soar at your command <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and build his nest on high? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13863">28</sup> He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a rocky crag is his stronghold. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13864">29</sup> From there he seeks out his food; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his eyes detect it from afar. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13865">30</sup> His young ones feast on blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and where the slain are, there is he.” </div></body></html>
