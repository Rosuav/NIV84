<h4>Revelation 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Throne in Heaven</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30754">1</sup> After
this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in
heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a
trumpet said, <font class='woj'>“Come up here, and I will show you
what must take place after this.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30755">2</sup> At once I was in the Spirit, and there
before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30756">3</sup> And the one who
sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow,
resembling an emerald, encircled the throne. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30757">4</sup> Surrounding the throne were
twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four
elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their
heads. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30758">5</sup> From the
throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder.
Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven
spirits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30758a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30759">6</sup> Also before the throne there was what
looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center, around the throne, were four
living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in
back. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30760">7</sup> The first
living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the
third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30761">8</sup> Each of the
four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all
around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop
saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Holy, holy, holy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the Lord God Almighty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who was, and is, and is to come.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30762">9</sup>
Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him
who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30763">10</sup> the twenty-four elders
fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who
lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne
and say:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30764">11</sup> “You
are worthy, our Lord and God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive glory and honor and power,<br>
for you created all things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by your will they were created<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have their being.”</p>
