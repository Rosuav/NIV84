<h4>Daniel 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Daniel’s Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21990">1</sup> In the
first year of Darius son of Xerxes<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21990a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> (a Mede
by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21990b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> kingdom— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21991">2</sup> in the first year of his reign, I,
Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of
the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of
Jerusalem would last seventy years. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21992">3</sup> So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded
with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and
ashes.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21993">4</sup> I
prayed to the LORD my God and confessed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps
his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21994">5</sup> we have sinned
and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have
turned away from your commands and laws. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21995">6</sup> We have not listened to your servants
the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and
our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21996">7</sup> “Lord,
you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the men
of Judah and people of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far,
in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our
unfaithfulness to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21997">8</sup> O LORD, we and our kings, our princes
and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned
against you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21998">9</sup>
The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have
rebelled against him; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21999">10</sup> we have not obeyed the LORD our God or
kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22000">11</sup> All Israel has
transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Therefore the curses and sworn judgments
written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured
out on us, because we have sinned against you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22001">12</sup> You have fulfilled the
words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us
great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done
like what has been done to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22002">13</sup> Just as it is written in the Law of
Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought
the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving
attention to your truth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22003">14</sup> The LORD did not hesitate to bring the
disaster upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything
he does; yet we have not obeyed him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22004">15</sup> “Now,
O Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty
hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we
have sinned, we have done wrong. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22005">16</sup> O Lord, in keeping with all your
righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem,
your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our
fathers have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to
all those around us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22006">17</sup> “Now,
our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your
sake, O Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22007">18</sup> Give ear, O
God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city
that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are
righteous, but because of your great mercy. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-22008">19</sup> O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O
Lord, hear and act! For your sake, O my God, do not delay, because
your city and your people bear your Name.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Seventy “Sevens”</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22009">20</sup> While I
was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my
people Israel and making my request to the LORD my God for his holy
hill— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22010">21</sup> while I
was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier
vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening
sacrifice. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22011">22</sup> He
instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you
insight and understanding. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22012">23</sup> As soon as you began to pray, an answer
was given, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly
esteemed. Therefore, consider the message and understand the
vision:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22013">24</sup>
“Seventy ‘sevens’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

decreed for your people and your holy city to finish<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22013d" title=

to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to
seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.<sup class=

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22014">25</sup> “Know
and understand this: From the issuing of the decree<sup class=

ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’
It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of
trouble. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22015">26</sup> After
the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be cut off and will
have nothing.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22015h"

will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will
come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations
have been decreed. <sup class="versenum" id=
