<h4>Joshua 18</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Division of the Rest of the Land</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6295">1</sup> The whole
assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent
of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6296">2</sup> but there were
still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their
inheritance.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6297">3</sup> So
Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you
begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your
fathers, has given you? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6298">4</sup> Appoint three men from each tribe. I will
send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a
description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they
will return to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6299">5</sup> You are to divide the land into seven
parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the
house of Joseph in its territory on the north. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6300">6</sup> After you have written
descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me
and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6301">7</sup> The Levites,
however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly
service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the
half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on
the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it
to them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6302">8</sup> As the
men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed
them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of
it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh
in the presence of the LORD.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6303">9</sup> So the men left and went through the
land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in
seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6304">10</sup> Joshua then
cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there
he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal
divisions.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Allotment for Benjamin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6305">11</sup> The lot
came up for the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted
territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6306">12</sup> On the
north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern
slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out
at the desert of Beth Aven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6307">13</sup> From there it crossed to the south slope
of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill
south of Lower Beth Horon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6308">14</sup> From
the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south
along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is,
Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the
western side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6309">15</sup> The
southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west,
and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6310">16</sup> The boundary
went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom,
north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley
along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6311">17</sup> It then curved
north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the
Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6312">18</sup> It continued to
the northern slope of Beth Arabah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6312a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and on
down into the Arabah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6313">19</sup> It then went to the northern slope of
Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt
Sea,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6313b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> at the mouth of the Jordan in the
south. This was the southern boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6314">20</sup> The
Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the boundaries that marked out the
inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6315">21</sup> The
tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, had the following cities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6316">22</sup> Beth Arabah, Zemaraim,
Bethel, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6317">23</sup> Avvim,
Parah, Ophrah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6318">24</sup>
Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Geba—twelve towns and their villages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6319">25</sup>
Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6320">26</sup> Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6321">27</sup> Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6322">28</sup> Zelah, Haeleph,
the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath—fourteen
towns and their villages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its
clans.</p>
