&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8865">20</sup> The

the kingdoms from the River<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8866b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to the
land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These

&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8874">29</sup> God gave

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8875">30</sup> Solomon’s
wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the East, and
greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8876">31</sup> He was wiser than any other man,
including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda,
the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding
nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8877">32</sup> He
spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and
five. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8878">33</sup> He
described plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that
grows out of walls. He also taught about animals and birds,
reptiles and fish. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8879">34</sup> Men of all nations came to listen to
Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard
