<h5 class="passage-header">The Word of Life</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30526">1</sup> That
which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have
touchedâ€”this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30527">2</sup> The life appeared; we have
seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life,
which was with the Father and has appeared to us. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30528">3</sup> We proclaim to you what we
have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us.
And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus
Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30529">4</sup> We
write this to make our<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30529a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> joy
complete.
<h5 class="passage-header">Walking in the Light</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30530">5</sup> This is
the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is
light; in him there is no darkness at all. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30531">6</sup> If we claim to have fellowship with
him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30532">7</sup> But if we walk
in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one
another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from
all<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30532b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> sin.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30533">8</sup> If we
claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not
in us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30534">9</sup> If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our
sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30535">10</sup> If we claim we have not sinned, we
make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our
lives.</p>
