<h4>1 Timothy 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29682">1</sup> Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of
Christ Jesus our hope,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29683">2</sup> To
Timothy my true son in the faith:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and
Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning Against False Teachers of the
Law</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29684">3</sup> As I
urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that
you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29685">4</sup> nor to devote
themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote
controversies rather than God’s work—which is by faith. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29686">5</sup> The goal of this command
is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a
sincere faith. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29687">6</sup>
Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29688">7</sup> They want to be
teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking
about or what they so confidently affirm.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29689">8</sup> We
know that the law is good if one uses it properly. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29690">9</sup> We also know that
law<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29690a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> is made not for the righteous but
for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
murderers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29691">10</sup> for
adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and
perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29692">11</sup> that conforms
to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to
me.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Lord’s Grace to Paul</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29693">12</sup> I thank
Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he
considered me faithful, appointing me to his service. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29694">13</sup> Even though I was once a
blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy
because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29695">14</sup> The grace of our Lord was poured out
on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ
Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29696">15</sup> Here
is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29697">16</sup> But for that
very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners,
Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for
those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29698">17</sup> Now to the
King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29699">18</sup>
Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the
prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may
fight the good fight, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29700">19</sup> holding on to faith and a good
conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their
faith. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29701">20</sup> Among
them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan
to be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
