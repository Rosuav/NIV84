<h4>Psalm 18</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Psalm 18</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. He sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:</b><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14120">1</sup> I love you, O LORD, my strength. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14121">2</sup> The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is my shield and the horn<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-14121a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of my salvation, my stronghold. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14122">3</sup> I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am saved from my enemies. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14123">4</sup> The cords of death entangled me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14124">5</sup> The cords of the grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-14124b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> coiled around me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the snares of death confronted me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14125">6</sup> In my distress I called to the LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried to my God for help. <br />From his temple he heard my voice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cry came before him, into his ears. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14126">7</sup> The earth trembled and quaked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the foundations of the mountains shook; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they trembled because he was angry. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14127">8</sup> Smoke rose from his nostrils; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consuming fire came from his mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning coals blazed out of it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14128">9</sup> He parted the heavens and came down; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark clouds were under his feet. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14129">10</sup> He mounted the cherubim and flew; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he soared on the wings of the wind. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14130">11</sup> He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dark rain clouds of the sky. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14131">12</sup> Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with hailstones and bolts of lightning. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14132">13</sup> The LORD thundered from heaven; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the voice of the Most High resounded.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-14132c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14133">14</sup> He shot his arrows and scattered the enemies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great bolts of lightning and routed them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14134">15</sup> The valleys of the sea were exposed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the foundations of the earth laid bare <br />at your rebuke, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the blast of breath from your nostrils. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14135">16</sup> He reached down from on high and took hold of me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he drew me out of deep waters. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14136">17</sup> He rescued me from my powerful enemy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from my foes, who were too strong for me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14137">18</sup> They confronted me in the day of my disaster, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD was my support. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14138">19</sup> He brought me out into a spacious place; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he rescued me because he delighted in me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14139">20</sup> The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14140">21</sup> For I have kept the ways of the LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not done evil by turning from my God. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14141">22</sup> All his laws are before me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not turned away from his decrees. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14142">23</sup> I have been blameless before him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have kept myself from sin. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14143">24</sup> The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14144">25</sup> To the faithful you show yourself faithful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the blameless you show yourself blameless, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14145">26</sup> to the pure you show yourself pure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14146">27</sup> You save the humble <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14147">28</sup> You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God turns my darkness into light. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14148">29</sup> With your help I can advance against a troop<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-14148d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my God I can scale a wall. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14149">30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word of the LORD is flawless. <br />He is a shield <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all who take refuge in him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14150">31</sup> For who is God besides the LORD? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who is the Rock except our God? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14151">32</sup> It is God who arms me with strength <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes my way perfect. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14152">33</sup> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he enables me to stand on the heights. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14153">34</sup> He trains my hands for battle; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14154">35</sup> You give me your shield of victory, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your right hand sustains me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you stoop down to make me great. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14155">36</sup> You broaden the path beneath me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that my ankles do not turn. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14156">37</sup> I pursued my enemies and overtook them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not turn back till they were destroyed. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14157">38</sup> I crushed them so that they could not rise; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fell beneath my feet. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14158">39</sup> You armed me with strength for battle; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you made my adversaries bow at my feet. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14159">40</sup> You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I destroyed my foes. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14160">41</sup> They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the LORD, but he did not answer. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14161">42</sup> I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I poured them out like mud in the streets. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14162">43</sup> You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have made me the head of nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people I did not know are subject to me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14163">44</sup> As soon as they hear me, they obey me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreigners cringe before me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14164">45</sup> They all lose heart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they come trembling from their strongholds. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14165">46</sup> The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exalted be God my Savior! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14166">47</sup> He is the God who avenges me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who subdues nations under me, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14167">48</sup> who saves me from my enemies. <br />You exalted me above my foes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from violent men you rescued me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14168">49</sup> Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing praises to your name. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14169">50</sup> He gives his king great victories; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to David and his descendants forever. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-14121a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-14121" title="Ir a Psalm 18:2">Psalm 18:2</a> <i>Horn</i> here symbolizes strength.</li>
