<h4>Ezekiel 39</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21450">1</sup> “Son
of man, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21450a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Meshech and Tubal. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21451">2</sup> I will turn you around and
drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you
against the mountains of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21452">3</sup> Then I will strike your bow from your
left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21453">4</sup> On the
mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the
nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion
birds and to the wild animals. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21454">5</sup> You will fall in the open field, for I
have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21455">6</sup> I will send fire on Magog and on those
who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21456">7</sup> “‘I
will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no
longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that
I the LORD am the Holy One in Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21457">8</sup> It is coming! It will surely take place,
declares the Sovereign LORD. This is the day I have spoken of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21458">9</sup> “‘Then
those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the
weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the
bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they
will use them for fuel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21459">10</sup> They will not need to gather wood from
the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the
weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them
and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21460">11</sup> “‘On
that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of
those who travel east toward<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21460b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the
Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21460c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> It will block the way of travelers,
because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be
called the Valley of Hamon Gog.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21460d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21461">12</sup> “‘For
seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to
cleanse the land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21462">13</sup> All the people of the land will bury
them, and the day I am glorified will be a memorable day for them,
declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21463">14</sup> “‘Men
will be regularly employed to cleanse the land. Some will go
throughout the land and, in addition to them, others will bury
those that remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months
they will begin their search. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21464">15</sup> As they go through the land and one of
them sees a human bone, he will set up a marker beside it until the
gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21465">16</sup> (Also a town called
Hamonah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21465e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> will be there.) And so they will
cleanse the land.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21466">17</sup> “Son
of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Call out to every
kind of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together
from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great
sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and
drink blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21467">18</sup>
You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the
princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and
bulls—all of them fattened animals from Bashan. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21468">19</sup> At the sacrifice I am
preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink
blood till you are drunk. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21469">20</sup> At my table you will eat your fill of
horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,’ declares
the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21470">21</sup> “I
will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will
see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay upon them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21471">22</sup> From that day
forward the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21472">23</sup> And the
nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for
their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face
from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell
by the sword. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21473">24</sup>
I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their
offenses, and I hid my face from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21474">25</sup>
“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will now bring
Jacob back from captivity<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21474f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> and will
have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous
for my holy name. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21475">26</sup> They will forget their shame and all
the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety
in their land with no one to make them afraid. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21476">27</sup> When I have brought them
back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of
their enemies, I will show myself holy through them in the sight of
many nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21477">28</sup>
Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, for though I sent
them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own
land, not leaving any behind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21478">29</sup> I will no longer hide my face from
them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel,
declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>
