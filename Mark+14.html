<p><h4>Mark 14</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24749">1</sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24750">2</sup> “But not during the Feast,” they said, “or the people may riot.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24751">3</sup> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24752">4</sup> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24753">5</sup> It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24753a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and the money given to the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24754">6</sup> “Leave her alone,”</font> said Jesus. <font class='woj'>“Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24755">7</sup> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24756">8</sup> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24757">9</sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24758">10</sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24759">11</sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <h5 class="passage-header">The Lord’s Supper</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24760">12</sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24761">13</sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, <font class='woj'>“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24762">14</sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24763">15</sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24764">16</sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24765">17</sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24766">18</sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24767">19</sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely not I?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24768">20</sup> “It is one of the Twelve,”</font> he replied, <font class='woj'>“one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24769">21</sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24770">22</sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, <font class='woj'>“Take it; this is my body.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24771">23</sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24772">24</sup> “This is my blood of the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24772b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> covenant, which is poured out for many,”</font> he said to them. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24773">25</sup> “I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24774">26</sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24775">27</sup> “You will all fall away,”</font> Jesus told them, <font class='woj'>“for it is written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘I will strike the shepherd,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and the sheep will be scattered.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24775c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24776">28</sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24777">29</sup> Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24778">30</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24778d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> you yourself will disown me three times.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24779">31</sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same. <h5 class="passage-header">Gethsemane</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24780">32</sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“Sit here while I pray.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24781">33</sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24782">34</sup> “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,”</font> he said to them. <font class='woj'>“Stay here and keep watch.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24783">35</sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24784">36</sup> “<i>Abba</i>,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24784e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> Father,”</font> he said, <font class='woj'>“everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24785">37</sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. <font class='woj'>“Simon,”</font> he said to Peter, <font class='woj'>“are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24786">38</sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24787">39</sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24788">40</sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24789">41</sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24790">42</sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Arrested</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24791">43</sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24792">44</sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24793">45</sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24794">46</sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24795">47</sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24796">48</sup> “Am I leading a rebellion,”</font> said Jesus, <font class='woj'>“that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24797">49</sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24798">50</sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24799">51</sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24800">52</sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <h5 class="passage-header">Before the Sanhedrin</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24801">53</sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24802">54</sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24803">55</sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24804">56</sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24805">57</sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24806">58</sup> “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.’” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24807">59</sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24808">60</sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24809">61</sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24809f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> the Son of the Blessed One?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24810">62</sup> “I am,”</font> said Jesus. <font class='woj'>“And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24811">63</sup> The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24812">64</sup> “You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all condemned him as worthy of death. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24813">65</sup> Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him. <h5 class="passage-header">Peter Disowns Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24814">66</sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24815">67</sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24816">68</sup> But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24816g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24817">69</sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24818">70</sup> Again he denied it. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24819">71</sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24820">72</sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24820h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: <font class='woj'>“Before the rooster crows twice<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24820i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> you will disown me three times.”</font> And he broke down and wept. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24753a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24753" title="Go to Mark 14:5">Mark 14:5</a> Greek <i>than three hundred denarii</i></li>
