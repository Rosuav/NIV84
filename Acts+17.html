<h4>Acts 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">In Thessalonica</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27512">1</sup> When they
had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to
Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27513">2</sup> As his custom was, Paul
went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with
them from the Scriptures, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27514">3</sup> explaining and proving that the
Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27514a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> had to suffer and rise from the dead.
“This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27514b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>” he said. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27515">4</sup> Some of the Jews were persuaded and
joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks
and not a few prominent women.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27516">5</sup> But
the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from
the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They
rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to
bring them out to the crowd.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27516c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27517">6</sup> But when they
did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers
before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused
trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27518">7</sup> and Jason has welcomed
them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying
that there is another king, one called Jesus.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27519">8</sup> When they heard this, the
crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27520">9</sup> Then they made Jason and
the others post bond and let them go.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">In Berea</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27521">10</sup> As soon
as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On
arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27522">11</sup> Now the Bereans were of
more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the
message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day
to see if what Paul said was true. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27523">12</sup> Many of the Jews believed, as did also
a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27524">13</sup> When
the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word
of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and
stirring them up. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27525">14</sup> The brothers immediately sent Paul to
the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27526">15</sup> The men who escorted Paul
brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and
Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">In Athens</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27527">16</sup> While
Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to
see that the city was full of idols. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27528">17</sup> So he reasoned in the synagogue with
the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace
day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27529">18</sup> A group of Epicurean and
Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked,
“What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to
be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was
preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27530">19</sup> Then they took
him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said
to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are
presenting? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27531">20</sup>
You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to
know what they mean.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27532">21</sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners
who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about
and listening to the latest ideas.)
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27533">22</sup> Paul
then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “Men of
Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27534">23</sup> For as I walked around
and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an
altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you
worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27535">24</sup> “The
God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven
and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27536">25</sup> And he is not served by
human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all
men life and breath and everything else. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27537">26</sup> From one man he made every nation of
men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined
the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27538">27</sup> God did this
so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find
him, though he is not far from each one of us. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27539">28</sup> ‘For in him we live and
move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We
are his offspring.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27540">29</sup>
“Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that
the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by
man’s design and skill. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27541">30</sup> In the past God overlooked such
ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27542">31</sup> For he has set
a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has
appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him
from the dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27543">32</sup> When
they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them
sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this
subject.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27544">33</sup> At
that, Paul left the Council. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27545">34</sup> A few men became followers of Paul and
believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also
a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.</p>
