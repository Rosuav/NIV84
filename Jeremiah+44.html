<p><h4>Jeremiah 44</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Disaster Because of Idolatry</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20012">1</sup> This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20012a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>—and in Upper Egypt<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20012b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20013">2</sup> “This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20014">3</sup> because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20015">4</sup> Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20016">5</sup> But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20017">6</sup> Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20018">7</sup> “Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20019">8</sup> Why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20020">9</sup> Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20021">10</sup> To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your fathers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20022">11</sup> “Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20023">12</sup> I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20024">13</sup> I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20025">14</sup> None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20026">15</sup> Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20026c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> said to Jeremiah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20027">16</sup> “We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20028">17</sup> We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20029">18</sup> But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20030">19</sup> The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20031">20</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20032">21</sup> “Did not the LORD remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your fathers, your kings and your officials and the people of the land? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20033">22</sup> When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20034">23</sup> Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20035">24</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20036">25</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said, ‘We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.’ <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20037">26</sup> But hear the word of the LORD, all Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20038">27</sup> For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20039">28</sup> Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20040">29</sup> “‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the LORD, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20041">30</sup> This is what the LORD says: ‘I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.’” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20012a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20012" title="Go to Jeremiah 44:1">Jeremiah 44:1</a> Hebrew <i>Noph</i></li>
