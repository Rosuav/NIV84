<h4>1 Corinthians 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Expel the Immoral Brother!</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28440">1</sup> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father’s wife. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28441">2</sup> And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28442">3</sup> Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28443">4</sup> When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28444">5</sup> hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28444a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28445">6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28446">7</sup> Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28447">8</sup> Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28448">9</sup> I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28449">10</sup> not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28450">11</sup> But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28451">12</sup> What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28452">13</sup> God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28452b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28444a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28444" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a> Or <i>that his body</i>; or <i>that the flesh</i></li>
