<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy to the Mountains of
Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21361">1</sup> “Son of
man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘O mountains of
Israel, hear the word of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21362">2</sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
The enemy said of you, “Aha! The ancient heights have become our
possession.”’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21363">3</sup>
Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Because they ravaged and hounded you from every side so that you
became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of
people’s malicious talk and slander, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21364">4</sup> therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear
the word of the Sovereign LORD: This is what the Sovereign LORD
says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the
desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and
ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21365">5</sup> this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the
nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice in
their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they
might plunder its pastureland.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21366">6</sup> Therefore prophesy concerning the land
of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and
valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I speak in my
jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21367">7</sup> Therefore this
is what the Sovereign LORD says: I swear with uplifted hand that
the nations around you will also suffer scorn.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21368">8</sup> “‘But
you, O mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my
people Israel, for they will soon come home. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21369">9</sup> I am concerned for you and will look
on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21370">10</sup> and I will multiply the
number of people upon you, even the whole house of Israel. The
towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21371">11</sup> I will increase the
number of men and animals upon you, and they will be fruitful and
become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and
will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I
am the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21372">12</sup> I
will cause people, my people Israel, to walk upon you. They will
possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never
again deprive them of their children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21373">13</sup>
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because people say to you,
“You devour men and deprive your nation of its children,”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21374">14</sup> therefore you
will no longer devour men or make your nation childless, declares
the Sovereign LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21375">15</sup> No longer will I make you hear the
taunts of the nations, and no longer will you suffer the scorn of
the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares the Sovereign
LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21376">16</sup> Again
the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21377">17</sup> “Son of man, when the people of Israel
were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and
their actions. Their conduct was like a woman’s monthly uncleanness
in my sight. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21378">18</sup>
So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the
land and because they had defiled it with their idols. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21379">19</sup> I dispersed them among
the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I
judged them according to their conduct and their actions.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21380">20</sup> And wherever
they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was
said of them, ‘These are the LORD’s people, and yet they had to
leave his land.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21381">21</sup> I had concern for my holy name, which
the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they had
gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21382">22</sup>
“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am
going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which
you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21383">23</sup> I will show
the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the
nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations
will know that I am the LORD, declares the Sovereign LORD, when I
show myself holy through you before their eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21384">24</sup> “‘For
I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the
countries and bring you back into your own land. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21385">25</sup> I will sprinkle clean
water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all
your impurities and from all your idols. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21386">26</sup> I will give you a new heart and put a
new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and
give you a heart of flesh. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21387">27</sup> And I will put my Spirit in you and
move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21388">28</sup> You will live
in the land I gave your forefathers; you will be my people, and I
will be your God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21389">29</sup> I will save you from all your
uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and
will not bring famine upon you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21390">30</sup> I will increase the fruit of the trees
and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer
disgrace among the nations because of famine. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21391">31</sup> Then you will remember your evil
ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins
and detestable practices. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21392">32</sup> I want you to know that I am not doing
this for your sake, declares the Sovereign LORD. Be ashamed and
disgraced for your conduct, O house of Israel!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21393">33</sup>
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I cleanse you
from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will
be rebuilt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21394">34</sup>
The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in
the sight of all who pass through it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21395">35</sup> They will say, “This land that was laid
waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were
lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and
inhabited.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21396">36</sup>
Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the LORD
have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was
desolate. I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21397">37</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says: Once again I will yield to the
plea of the house of Israel and do this for them: I will make their
people as numerous as sheep, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21398">38</sup> as numerous as the flocks for offerings
at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts. So will the ruined cities
be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the
LORD.”</p>
