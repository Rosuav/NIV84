<h4>1 Timothy 4</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Instructions to Timothy</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29733">1</sup> The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29734">2</sup> Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29735">3</sup> They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29736">4</sup> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29737">5</sup> because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29738">6</sup> If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29739">7</sup> Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29740">8</sup> For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29741">9</sup> This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29742">10</sup> (and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29743">11</sup> Command and teach these things. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29744">12</sup> Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29745">13</sup> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29746">14</sup> Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29747">15</sup> Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29748">16</sup> Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers. </div></body></html>
