<p><h4>Isaiah 65</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Judgment and Salvation</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18899">1</sup> “I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was found by those who did not seek me. <br />To a nation that did not call on my name, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, ‘Here am I, here am I.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18900">2</sup> All day long I have held out my hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to an obstinate people, <br />who walk in ways not good, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuing their own imaginations— <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18901">3</sup> a people who continually provoke me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my very face, <br />offering sacrifices in gardens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and burning incense on altars of brick; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18902">4</sup> who sit among the graves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; <br />who eat the flesh of pigs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18903">5</sup> who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am too sacred for you!’ <br />Such people are smoke in my nostrils, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fire that keeps burning all day. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18904">6</sup> “See, it stands written before me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pay it back into their laps— <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18905">7</sup> both your sins and the sins of your fathers,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. <br />“Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and defied me on the hills, <br />I will measure into their laps <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the full payment for their former deeds.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18906">8</sup> This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and men say, ‘Don’t destroy it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is yet some good in it,’ <br />so will I do in behalf of my servants; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not destroy them all. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18907">9</sup> I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; <br />my chosen people will inherit them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there will my servants live. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18908">10</sup> Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my people who seek me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18909">11</sup> “But as for you who forsake the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forget my holy mountain, <br />who spread a table for Fortune <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18910">12</sup> I will destine you for the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will all bend down for the slaughter; <br />for I called but you did not answer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke but you did not listen. <br />You did evil in my sight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and chose what displeases me.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18911">13</sup> Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My servants will eat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will go hungry; <br />my servants will drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will go thirsty; <br />my servants will rejoice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will be put to shame. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18912">14</sup> My servants will sing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the joy of their hearts, <br />but you will cry out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from anguish of heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wail in brokenness of spirit. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18913">15</sup> You will leave your name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my chosen ones as a curse; <br />the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to his servants he will give another name. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18914">16</sup> Whoever invokes a blessing in the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will do so by the God of truth; <br />he who takes an oath in the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will swear by the God of truth. <br />For the past troubles will be forgotten <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hidden from my eyes. <h5 class="passage-header">New Heavens and a New Earth</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18915">17</sup> “Behold, I will create <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new heavens and a new earth. <br />The former things will not be remembered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will they come to mind. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18916">18</sup> But be glad and rejoice forever <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in what I will create, <br />for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its people a joy. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18917">19</sup> I will rejoice over Jerusalem <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take delight in my people; <br />the sound of weeping and of crying <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be heard in it no more. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18918">20</sup> “Never again will there be in it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an infant who lives but a few days, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an old man who does not live out his years; <br />he who dies at a hundred <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be thought a mere youth; <br />he who fails to reach<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18918a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> a hundred <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be considered accursed. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18919">21</sup> They will build houses and dwell in them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18920">22</sup> No longer will they build houses and others live in them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or plant and others eat. <br />For as the days of a tree, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so will be the days of my people; <br />my chosen ones will long enjoy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the works of their hands. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18921">23</sup> They will not toil in vain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or bear children doomed to misfortune; <br />for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they and their descendants with them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18922">24</sup> Before they call I will answer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while they are still speaking I will hear. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18923">25</sup> The wolf and the lamb will feed together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the lion will eat straw like the ox, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but dust will be the serpent’s food. <br />They will neither harm nor destroy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all my holy mountain,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18918a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18918" title="Go to Isaiah 65:20">Isaiah 65:20</a> Or <i>/ the sinner who reaches</i></li>
