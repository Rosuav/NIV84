<h4>Deuteronomy 14</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Clean and Unclean Food</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5292">1</sup> You are the children of the LORD your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5293">2</sup> for you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the LORD has chosen you to be his treasured possession. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5294">3</sup> Do not eat any detestable thing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5295">4</sup> These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5296">5</sup> the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5296a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5297">6</sup> You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5298">7</sup> However, of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the coney.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5298b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Although they chew the cud, they do not have a split hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5299">8</sup> The pig is also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5300">9</sup> Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5301">10</sup> But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5302">11</sup> You may eat any clean bird. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5303">12</sup> But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5304">13</sup> the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5305">14</sup> any kind of raven, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5306">15</sup> the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5307">16</sup> the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5308">17</sup> the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5309">18</sup> the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5310">19</sup> All flying insects that swarm are unclean to you; do not eat them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5311">20</sup> But any winged creature that is clean you may eat. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5312">21</sup> Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to an alien living in any of your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are a people holy to the LORD your God. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. <h5 class="passage-header">Tithes</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5313">22</sup> Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5314">23</sup> Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5315">24</sup> But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the LORD your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the LORD will choose to put his Name is so far away), <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5316">25</sup> then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the LORD your God will choose. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5317">26</sup> Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5318">27</sup> And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5319">28</sup> At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5320">29</sup> so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-5296a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-5296" title="Ir a Deuteronomy 14:5">Deuteronomy 14:5</a> The precise identification of some of the birds and animals in this chapter is uncertain.</li>
