<p><h4>Joel 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">An Army of Locusts</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22313">1</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound the alarm on my holy hill. <br />Let all who live in the land tremble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the day of the LORD is coming. <br />It is close at hand— <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22314">2</sup> a day of darkness and gloom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a day of clouds and blackness. <br />Like dawn spreading across the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a large and mighty army comes, <br />such as never was of old <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor ever will be in ages to come. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22315">3</sup> Before them fire devours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind them a flame blazes. <br />Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind them, a desert waste— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing escapes them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22316">4</sup> They have the appearance of horses; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they gallop along like cavalry. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22317">5</sup> With a noise like that of chariots <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they leap over the mountaintops, <br />like a crackling fire consuming stubble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a mighty army drawn up for battle. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22318">6</sup> At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every face turns pale. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22319">7</sup> They charge like warriors; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they scale walls like soldiers. <br />They all march in line, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not swerving from their course. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22320">8</sup> They do not jostle each other; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each marches straight ahead. <br />They plunge through defenses <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without breaking ranks. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22321">9</sup> They rush upon the city; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they run along the wall. <br />They climb into the houses; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like thieves they enter through the windows. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22322">10</sup> Before them the earth shakes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sky trembles, <br />the sun and moon are darkened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the stars no longer shine. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22323">11</sup> The LORD thunders <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of his army; <br />his forces are beyond number, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mighty are those who obey his command. <br />The day of the LORD is great; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is dreadful. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can endure it? <h5 class="passage-header">Rend Your Heart</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22324">12</sup> “Even now,” declares the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“return to me with all your heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fasting and weeping and mourning.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22325">13</sup> Rend your heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not your garments. <br />Return to the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is gracious and compassionate, <br />slow to anger and abounding in love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he relents from sending calamity. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22326">14</sup> Who knows? He may turn and have pity <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leave behind a blessing— <br />grain offerings and drink offerings <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD your God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22327">15</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare a holy fast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call a sacred assembly. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22328">16</sup> Gather the people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consecrate the assembly; <br />bring together the elders, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather the children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those nursing at the breast. <br />Let the bridegroom leave his room <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the bride her chamber. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22329">17</sup> Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weep between the temple porch and the altar. <br />Let them say, “Spare your people, O LORD. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a byword among the nations. <br />Why should they say among the peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Where is their God?’” <h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Answer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22330">18</sup> Then the LORD will be jealous for his land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take pity on his people. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22331">19</sup> The LORD will reply<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22331a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> to them: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am sending you grain, new wine and oil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to satisfy you fully; <br />never again will I make you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an object of scorn to the nations. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22332">20</sup> “I will drive the northern army far from you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pushing it into a parched and barren land, <br />with its front columns going into the eastern sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22332b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those in the rear into the western sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22332c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <br />And its stench will go up; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its smell will rise.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely he has done great things.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22332d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22333">21</sup> Be not afraid, O land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be glad and rejoice. <br />Surely the LORD has done great things. <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22334">22</sup> Be not afraid, O wild animals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the open pastures are becoming green. <br />The trees are bearing their fruit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fig tree and the vine yield their riches. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22335">23</sup> Be glad, O people of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice in the LORD your God, <br />for he has given you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the autumn rains in righteousness.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22335e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> <br />He sends you abundant showers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both autumn and spring rains, as before. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22336">24</sup> The threshing floors will be filled with grain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22337">25</sup> “I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great locust and the young locust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other locusts and the locust swarm<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22337f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>— <br />my great army that I sent among you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22338">26</sup> You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has worked wonders for you; <br />never again will my people be shamed. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22339">27</sup> Then you will know that I am in Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I am the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that there is no other; <br />never again will my people be shamed. <h5 class="passage-header">The Day of the LORD</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22340">28</sup> “And afterward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit on all people. <br />Your sons and daughters will prophesy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your old men will dream dreams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your young men will see visions. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22341">29</sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit in those days. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22342">30</sup> I will show wonders in the heavens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood and fire and billows of smoke. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22343">31</sup> The sun will be turned to darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon to blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22344">32</sup> And everyone who calls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the name of the LORD will be saved; <br />for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be deliverance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the LORD has said, <br />among the survivors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom the LORD calls. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22331a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22331" title="Go to Joel 2:19">Joel 2:19</a> Or <i>LORD was jealous… / and took pity… / 19 The LORD replied</i></li>
