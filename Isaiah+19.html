<h4>Isaiah 19</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy About Egypt</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18006">1</sup> An oracle concerning Egypt: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is coming to Egypt. <br />The idols of Egypt tremble before him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18007">2</sup> “I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother will fight against brother, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbor against neighbor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city against city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom against kingdom. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18008">3</sup> The Egyptians will lose heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will bring their plans to nothing; <br />they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mediums and the spiritists. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18009">4</sup> I will hand the Egyptians over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the power of a cruel master, <br />and a fierce king will rule over them,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18010">5</sup> The waters of the river will dry up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the riverbed will be parched and dry. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18011">6</sup> The canals will stink; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. <br />The reeds and rushes will wither, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18012">7</sup> also the plants along the Nile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the mouth of the river. <br />Every sown field along the Nile <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will become parched, will blow away and be no more. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18013">8</sup> The fishermen will groan and lament, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who cast hooks into the Nile; <br />those who throw nets on the water <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will pine away. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18014">9</sup> Those who work with combed flax will despair, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the weavers of fine linen will lose hope. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18015">10</sup> The workers in cloth will be dejected, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the wage earners will be sick at heart. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18016">11</sup> The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. <br />How can you say to Pharaoh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am one of the wise men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a disciple of the ancient kings”? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18017">12</sup> Where are your wise men now? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them show you and make known <br />what the LORD Almighty <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has planned against Egypt. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18018">13</sup> The officials of Zoan have become fools, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the leaders of Memphis<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18018a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> are deceived; <br />the cornerstones of her peoples <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have led Egypt astray. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18019">14</sup> The LORD has poured into them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a spirit of dizziness; <br />they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18020">15</sup> There is nothing Egypt can do— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head or tail, palm branch or reed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18021">16</sup> In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18022">17</sup> And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18023">18</sup> In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of Destruction.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18023b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18024">19</sup> In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18025">20</sup> It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18026">21</sup> So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18027">22</sup> The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18028">23</sup> In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18029">24</sup> In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18030">25</sup> The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18018a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18018" title="Ir a Isaiah 19:13">Isaiah 19:13</a> Hebrew <i>Noph</i></li>
