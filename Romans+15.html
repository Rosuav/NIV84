<h4>Romans 15</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28290">1</sup> We who
are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to
please ourselves. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28291">2</sup> Each of us should please his neighbor
for his good, to build him up. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28292">3</sup> For even Christ did not please himself
but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have
fallen on me.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28292a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28293">4</sup> For everything that was written in the
past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the
encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28294">5</sup> May
the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of
unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28295">6</sup> so that with one heart and
mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28296">7</sup> Accept
one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring
praise to God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28297">8</sup>
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the
Jews<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28297b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm
the promises made to the patriarchs <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28298">9</sup> so that the Gentiles may glorify God for
his mercy, as it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Therefore I will praise you among the
Gentiles;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing hymns to your name.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28298c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28299">10</sup>
Again, it says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his
people.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28299d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28300">11</sup> And
again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing praises to him, all you
peoples.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28300e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28301">12</sup> And
again, Isaiah says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Root of Jesse will spring up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one who will arise to rule over the nations;<br>
the Gentiles will hope in him.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28301f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28302">13</sup> May
the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in
him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28303">14</sup> I myself
am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of
goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one
another. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28304">15</sup> I
have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you
of them again, because of the grace God gave me <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28305">16</sup> to be a minister of
Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming
the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering
acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28306">17</sup>
Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28307">18</sup> I will not venture to
speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in
leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28308">19</sup> by the power
of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from
Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed
the gospel of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28309">20</sup> It has always been my ambition to
preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not
be building on someone else’s foundation. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28310">21</sup> Rather, as it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Those who were not told about him will
see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who have not heard will
understand.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28310g"
title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28311">22</sup> This
is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Plan to Visit Rome</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28312">23</sup> But now
that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and
since I have been longing for many years to see you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28313">24</sup> I plan to do so when I go
to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you
assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company
for a while. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28314">25</sup>
Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the
saints there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28315">26</sup>
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for
the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28316">27</sup> They were pleased to do it, and indeed
they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’
spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them
their material blessings. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28317">28</sup> So after I have completed this task and
have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to
Spain and visit you on the way. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28318">29</sup> I know that when I come to you, I will
come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28319">30</sup> I
urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the
Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28320">31</sup> Pray that I
may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in
Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28321">32</sup> so that by God’s will I
may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28322">33</sup> The God of
peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
