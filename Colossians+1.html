<h4>Colossians 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29451">1</sup> Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our
brother,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29452">2</sup> To the
holy and faithful<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29452a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
brothers in Christ at Colosse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace and peace to you from God our
Father.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29452b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving and Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29453">3</sup> We always
thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for
you, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29454">4</sup> because we
have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have
for all the saints— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29455">5</sup> the faith and love that spring from the
hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already
heard about in the word of truth, the gospel <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29456">6</sup> that has come to you. All over the
world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been
doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God’s
grace in all its truth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29457">7</sup> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear
fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on
our<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29457c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> behalf, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29458">8</sup> and who also told us of your love in the
Spirit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29459">9</sup> For
this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped
praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of
his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29460">10</sup> And we pray
this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may
please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing
in the knowledge of God, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29461">11</sup> being strengthened with all power
according to his glorious might so that you may have great
endurance and patience, and joyfully <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29462">12</sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has
qualified you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29462d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> to share in the inheritance
of the saints in the kingdom of light. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29463">13</sup> For he has rescued us from the dominion
of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29464">14</sup> in whom we
have redemption,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29464e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> the
forgiveness of sins.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Supremacy of Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29465">15</sup> He is
the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29466">16</sup> For by him all
things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and
invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all
things were created by him and for him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29467">17</sup> He is before all things, and in him all
things hold together. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29468">18</sup> And he is the head of the body, the
church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead,
so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29469">19</sup> For God was pleased to
have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29470">20</sup> and through him to reconcile to himself
all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making
peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29471">21</sup> Once
you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because
of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29471f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> your evil behavior. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29472">22</sup> But now he has reconciled
you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in
his sight, without blemish and free from accusation— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29473">23</sup> if you continue in your
faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in
the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been
proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul,
have become a servant.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Labor for the Church</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29474">24</sup> Now I
rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh
what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the
sake of his body, which is the church. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29475">25</sup> I have become its servant by the
commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its
fullness— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29476">26</sup> the
mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is
now disclosed to the saints. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29477">27</sup> To them God has chosen to make known
among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is
Christ in you, the hope of glory.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29478">28</sup> We
proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so
that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29479">29</sup> To this end I labor,
struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in
me.</p>
