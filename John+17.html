<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Prays for Himself</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26750">1</sup> After
Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Father, the time has come.
Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26751">2</sup> For you granted him authority over all
people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given
him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26752">3</sup> Now this is eternal life: that they may
know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have
sent.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26753">4</sup> I have brought you glory on earth by
completing the work you gave me to do.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26754">5</sup> And now,
Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you
before the world began.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Prays for His Disciples</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26755a" title=

world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed
your word.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26756">7</sup> Now they know that everything you have
given me comes from you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26757">8</sup> For I gave them the words
you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I
came from you, and they believed that you sent me.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26758">9</sup> I pray for them. I am not praying for
the world, but for those you have given me, for they are
yours.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

is mine. And glory has come to me through them.</font> <font class=

remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and
I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your
name—the name you gave me—so that they may be one as we are
one.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26761">12</sup> While I was with them, I protected them
and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost
except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be
fulfilled.</font>

"en-NIV1984-26762">13</sup> “I am coming to you now, but I say
these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have
the full measure of my joy within them.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26763">14</sup> I have
given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not
of the world any more than I am of the world.</font> <font class=

prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you
protect them from the evil one.</font> <font class=

not of the world, even as I am not of it.</font> <font class=
