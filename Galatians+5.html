<h4>Galatians 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Freedom in Christ</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29148">1</sup> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29149">2</sup> Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29150">3</sup> Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29151">4</sup> You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29152">5</sup> But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29153">6</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29154">7</sup> You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29155">8</sup> That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29156">9</sup> “A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29157">10</sup> I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29158">11</sup> Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29159">12</sup> As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29160">13</sup> You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29160a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>; rather, serve one another in love. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29161">14</sup> The entire law is summed up in a single command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29161b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29162">15</sup> If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. <h5 class="passage-header">Life by the Spirit</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29163">16</sup> So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29164">17</sup> For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29165">18</sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29166">19</sup> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29167">20</sup> idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29168">21</sup> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29169">22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29170">23</sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29171">24</sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29172">25</sup> Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29173">26</sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29160a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29160" title="Ir a Galatians 5:13">Galatians 5:13</a> Or <i>the flesh</i>; also in verses 16, 17, 19 and 24</li>
