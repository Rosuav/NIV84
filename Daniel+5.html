<h4>Daniel 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Writing on the Wall</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21876">1</sup> King
Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and
drank wine with them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21877">2</sup> While Belshazzar was drinking his wine,
he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that
Nebuchadnezzar his father<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21877a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> had taken
from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his
wives and his concubines might drink from them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21878">3</sup> So they brought in the
gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in
Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his
concubines drank from them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21879">4</sup> As they drank the wine, they praised the
gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21880">5</sup>
Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the
plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The
king watched the hand as it wrote. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21881">6</sup> His face turned pale and he was so
frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave
way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21882">7</sup> The
king called out for the enchanters, astrologers<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21882b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and diviners to be brought and said
to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells
me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain
placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler
in the kingdom.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21883">8</sup> Then
all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the
writing or tell the king what it meant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21884">9</sup> So King Belshazzar became even more
terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21885">10</sup> The
queen,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21885c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> hearing the voices of the king and
his nobles, came into the banquet hall. “O king, live forever!” she
said. “Don’t be alarmed! Don’t look so pale! <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21886">11</sup> There is a man in your kingdom who
has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father
he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that
of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king,
I say—appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers
and diviners. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21887">12</sup>
This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to
have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the
ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult
problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing
means.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21888">13</sup> So
Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are
you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from
Judah? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21889">14</sup> I have
heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have
insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21890">15</sup> The wise men and enchanters were
brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means,
but they could not explain it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21891">16</sup> Now I have heard that you are able to
give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can
read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in
purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will
be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21892">17</sup> Then
Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and
give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the
writing for the king and tell him what it means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21893">18</sup> “O
king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty
and greatness and glory and splendor. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21894">19</sup> Because of the high position he gave
him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded
and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to
death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to
promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21895">20</sup> But when his
heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from
his royal throne and stripped of his glory. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21896">21</sup> He was driven away from people and
given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate
grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of
heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign
over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21897">22</sup> “But
you his son,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21897d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> O Belshazzar, have not humbled
yourself, though you knew all this. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21898">23</sup> Instead, you have set yourself up
against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple
brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your
concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and
gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or
understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand
your life and all your ways. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21899">24</sup> Therefore he sent the hand that wrote
the inscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21900">25</sup> “This
is the inscription that was written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21900e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21901">26</sup> “This
is what these words mean:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mene</i><sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21901f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>: God has
numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21902">27</sup>
<i>Tekel</i><sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21902g"
title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>: You have been weighed on the
scales and found wanting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21903">28</sup>
<i>Peres</i><sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21903h"
title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup>: Your kingdom is divided and
given to the Medes and Persians.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21904">29</sup> Then
at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain
was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest
ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21905">30</sup> That
very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21905i" title=
"See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> was slain, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21906">31</sup> and Darius the Mede took over the
kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.</p>
