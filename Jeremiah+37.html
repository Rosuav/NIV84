<p><h4>Jeremiah 37</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah in Prison</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19876">1</sup> Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19876a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> son of Jehoiakim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19877">2</sup> Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19878">3</sup> King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the LORD our God for us.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19879">4</sup> Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19880">5</sup> Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19880b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19881">6</sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19882">7</sup> “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19883">8</sup> Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19884">9</sup> “This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19885">10</sup> Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19885c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19886">11</sup> After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19887">12</sup> Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19888">13</sup> But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19889">14</sup> “That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19890">15</sup> They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19891">16</sup> Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19892">17</sup> Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the LORD?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be handed over to the king of Babylon.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19893">18</sup> Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, that you have put me in prison? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19894">19</sup> Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19895">20</sup> But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19896">21</sup> King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-19876a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-19876" title="Go to Jeremiah 37:1">Jeremiah 37:1</a> Hebrew <i>Coniah,</i> a variant of <i>Jehoiachin</i></li>
