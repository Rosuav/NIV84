<p><h4>Mark 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Triumphal Entry</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24636">1</sup> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24637">2</sup> saying to them, <font class='woj'>“Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24638">3</sup> If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24639">4</sup> They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24640">5</sup> some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24641">6</sup> They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24642">7</sup> When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24643">8</sup> Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24644">9</sup> Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hosanna!<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24644a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24644b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24645">10</sup> “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hosanna in the highest!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24646">11</sup> Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Clears the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24647">12</sup> The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24648">13</sup> Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24649">14</sup> Then he said to the tree, <font class='woj'>“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”</font> And his disciples heard him say it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24650">15</sup> On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24651">16</sup> and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24652">17</sup> And as he taught them, he said, <font class='woj'>“Is it not written:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘My house will be called</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>a house of prayer for all nations’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24652c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>?</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24652d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24653">18</sup> The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24654">19</sup> When evening came, they<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24654e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> went out of the city. <h5 class="passage-header">The Withered Fig Tree</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24655">20</sup> In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24656">21</sup> Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24657">22</sup> “Have<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24657f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> faith in God,”</font> Jesus answered. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24658">23</sup> “I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24659">24</sup> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24660">25</sup> And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24660g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24661">27</sup> They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24662">28</sup> “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24663">29</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24664">30</sup> John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24665">31</sup> They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24666">32</sup> But if we say, ‘From men’…” (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24667">33</sup> So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24644a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24644" title="Go to Mark 11:9">Mark 11:9</a> A Hebrew expression meaning “Save!” which became an exclamation of praise; also in verse 10</li>
