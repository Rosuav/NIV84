<h4>2 Thessalonians 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Man of Lawlessness</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29647">1</sup> Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29648">2</sup> not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29649">3</sup> Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29649a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29650">4</sup> He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29651">5</sup> Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29652">6</sup> And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29653">7</sup> For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29654">8</sup> And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29655">9</sup> The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29656">10</sup> and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29657">11</sup> For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29658">12</sup> and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness. <h5 class="passage-header">Stand Firm</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29659">13</sup> But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29659b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29660">14</sup> He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29661">15</sup> So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29661c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29662">16</sup> May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29663">17</sup> encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29649a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29649" title="Ir a 2 Thessalonians 2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a> Some manuscripts <i>sin</i></li>
