<h4>2 Chronicles 23</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11658">1</sup> In the
seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with
the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham,
Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of
Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11659">2</sup> They went throughout Judah and gathered
the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns.
When they came to Jerusalem, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11660">3</sup> the whole assembly made a covenant with
the king at the temple of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son shall
reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11661">4</sup> Now this is
what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are
going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11662">5</sup> a third of you
at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the
other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11663">6</sup> No one is to
enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on
duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the
other men are to guard what the LORD has assigned to
them.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11663a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11664">7</sup> The Levites are to station themselves
around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who
enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king
wherever he goes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11665">8</sup> The
Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest
ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the
Sabbath and those who were going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest
had not released any of the divisions. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11666">9</sup> Then he gave the commanders of units of
a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had
belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11667">10</sup> He stationed
all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king—near
the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of
the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11668">11</sup>
Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son and put the crown
on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and
proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the
king!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11669">12</sup> When
Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the
king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11670">13</sup> She looked, and there was
the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and
the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land
were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical
instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes
and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11671">14</sup>
Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred,
who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: “Bring her out
between the ranks<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11671b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and
put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said,
“Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11672">15</sup> So they seized her as she
reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and
there they put her to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11673">16</sup>
Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the
king<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11673c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> would be the LORD’s people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11674">17</sup> All the people
went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the
altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of
the altars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11675">18</sup> Then
Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the
hands of the priests, who were Levites, to whom David had made
assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the
LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as
David had ordered. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11676">19</sup> He also stationed doorkeepers at the
gates of the LORD’s temple so that no one who was in any way
unclean might enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11677">20</sup> He
took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of
the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down
from the temple of the LORD. They went into the palace through the
Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11678">21</sup> and all the people of the
land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been
slain with the sword.</p>
