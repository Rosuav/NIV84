<h5 class="passage-header">Ahijah’s Prophecy Against Jeroboam</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9220">1</sup> At that
time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9221">2</sup> and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go,
disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of
Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one
who told me I would be king over this people. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9222">3</sup> Take ten loaves of bread with you,
some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what
will happen to the boy.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9223">4</sup> So Jeroboam’s wife did what he said and
went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone
because of his age. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9224">5</sup> But the LORD had told Ahijah, “Jeroboam’s
wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are
to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will
pretend to be someone else.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9225">6</sup> So when
Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, “Come
in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you
with bad news. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9226">7</sup>
Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel,
says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader
over my people Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9227">8</sup> I tore the kingdom away from the house of
David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant
David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart,
doing only what was right in my eyes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9228">9</sup> You have done more evil than all who
lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made
of metal; you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your
back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9229">10</sup>
“‘Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of
Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in
Israel—slave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one
burns dung, until it is all gone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9230">11</sup> Dogs will eat those belonging to
Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on
those who die in the country. The LORD has spoken!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9231">12</sup> “As
for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will
die. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9232">13</sup> All Israel
will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to
Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the
house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found
anything good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9233">14</sup> “The
LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off
the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even
now.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9233a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9234">15</sup> And the LORD will strike Israel, so that
it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel
from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter
them beyond the River,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9234b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> because
they provoked the LORD to anger by making Asherah poles.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9234c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9235">16</sup> And he will give Israel up because of
the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to
commit.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9236">17</sup> Then
Jeroboam’s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she
stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9237">18</sup> They buried him, and all
Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant
the prophet Ahijah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9238">19</sup> The
other events of Jeroboam’s reign, his wars and how he ruled, are
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9239">20</sup> He reigned for
twenty-two years and then rested with his fathers. And Nadab his
son succeeded him as king.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Rehoboam King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9240">21</sup> Rehoboam
son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when
he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the
city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which
to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9241">22</sup> Judah
did evil in the eyes of the LORD. By the sins they committed they
stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9242">23</sup> They also set
up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on
every high hill and under every spreading tree. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9243">24</sup> There were even male
shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the
detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before
the Israelites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9244">25</sup> In the
fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9245">26</sup> He
carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the
treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all
the gold shields Solomon had made. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9246">27</sup> So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to
replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on
duty at the entrance to the royal palace. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9247">28</sup> Whenever the king went to the LORD’s
temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned
them to the guardroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9248">29</sup> As for
the other events of Rehoboam’s reign, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9249">30</sup> There was
continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9250">31</sup> And Rehoboam rested with
his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. His
mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And
Abijah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9250d" title=
