<p><h4>Ezekiel 35</h4><h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Edom</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21346">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21347">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21348">3</sup> and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21349">4</sup> I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21350">5</sup> “‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21351">6</sup> therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21352">7</sup> I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21353">8</sup> I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21354">9</sup> I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21355">10</sup> “‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,” even though I the LORD was there, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21356">11</sup> therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21357">12</sup> Then you will know that I the LORD have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21358">13</sup> You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21359">14</sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21360">15</sup> Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, O Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’” </p></div></body></html>
