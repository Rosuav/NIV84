and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of
being alive, but you are dead.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=

remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds
complete in the sight of my God.</font> <font class=

therefore, what you have received and heard; obey it, and repent.
But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will
not know at what time I will come to you.</font></p>

white, for they are worthy.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=

like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from
the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father

synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but
are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and
acknowledge that I have loved you.</font> <font class=

name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down
out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new
name.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can
become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your

see.</font></p>
