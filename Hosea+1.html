<p><h4>Hosea 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22096">1</sup> The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22096a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> king of Israel: <h5 class="passage-header">Hosea’s Wife and Children</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22097">2</sup> When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, “Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22098">3</sup> So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22099">4</sup> Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22100">5</sup> In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22101">6</sup> Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22101b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22102">7</sup> Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22103">8</sup> After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22104">9</sup> Then the LORD said, “Call him Lo-Ammi,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22104c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> for you are not my people, and I am not your God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22105">10</sup> “Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22106">11</sup> The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited, and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22096a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22096" title="Go to Hosea 1:1">Hosea 1:1</a> Hebrew <i>Joash,</i> a variant of <i>Jehoash</i></li>
