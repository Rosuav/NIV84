<h4>John 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Talks With a Samaritan Woman</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26148">1</sup> The
Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples
than John, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26149">2</sup>
although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26150">3</sup> When the Lord
learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26151">4</sup> Now he
had to go through Samaria. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26152">5</sup> So he came to a town in Samaria called
Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26153">6</sup> Jacob’s well
was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by
the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26154">7</sup> When a
Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, <font class=
'woj'>“Will you give me a drink?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26155">8</sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to
buy food.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26156">9</sup> The
Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan
woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate
with Samaritans.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26156a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26157">10</sup> Jesus
answered her, <font class='woj'>“If you knew the gift of God and
who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and
he would have given you living water.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26158">11</sup>
“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well
is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26159">12</sup> Are you greater than our father
Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also
his sons and his flocks and herds?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26160">13</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“Everyone who drinks this water will be
thirsty again,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26161">14</sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him
will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him
a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26162">15</sup> The
woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get
thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26163">16</sup> He
told her, <font class='woj'>“Go, call your husband and come
back.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26164">17</sup> “I
have no husband,” she replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said to her, <font class='woj'>“You are
right when you say you have no husband.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26165">18</sup> The fact
is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not
your husband. What you have just said is quite true.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26166">19</sup>
“Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26167">20</sup> Our fathers
worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where
we must worship is in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26168">21</sup> Jesus
declared, <font class='woj'>“Believe me, woman, a time is coming
when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in
Jerusalem.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26169">22</sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not
know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the
Jews.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26170">23</sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and
truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26171">24</sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must
worship in spirit and in truth.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26172">25</sup> The
woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When
he comes, he will explain everything to us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26173">26</sup> Then
Jesus declared, <font class='woj'>“I who speak to you am
he.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Disciples Rejoin Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26174">27</sup> Just
then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking
with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you
talking with her?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26175">28</sup> Then,
leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to
the people, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26176">29</sup>
“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be
the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26176b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26177">30</sup> They came out of the town and made
their way toward him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26178">31</sup>
Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26179">32</sup> But
he said to them, <font class='woj'>“I have food to eat that you
know nothing about.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26180">33</sup> Then
his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him
food?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26181">34</sup> “My food,”</font> said Jesus,
<font class='woj'>“is to do the will of him who sent me and to
finish his work.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26182">35</sup> Do you not say, ‘Four months more and
then the harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the
fields! They are ripe for harvest.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26183">36</sup> Even now
the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for
eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad
together.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26184">37</sup> Thus the saying ‘One sows and another
reaps’ is true.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26185">38</sup> I sent you to reap what you have not
worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the
benefits of their labor.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Many Samaritans Believe</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26186">39</sup> Many of
the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the
woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26187">40</sup> So when the Samaritans
came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two
days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26188">41</sup> And
because of his words many more became believers.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26189">42</sup> They
said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you
said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man
really is the Savior of the world.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals the Official’s Son</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26190">43</sup> After
the two days he left for Galilee. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26191">44</sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that
a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26192">45</sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the
Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in
Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26193">46</sup> Once
more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into
wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at
Capernaum. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26194">47</sup>
When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea,
he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was
close to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26195">48</sup> “Unless you people see miraculous signs
and wonders,”</font> Jesus told him, <font class='woj'>“you will
never believe.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26196">49</sup> The
royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26197">50</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“You may go. Your son will
live.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26198">51</sup> While he was
still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy
was living. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26199">52</sup>
When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said
to him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26200">53</sup> Then
the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had
said to him, <font class='woj'>“Your son will live.”</font> So he
and all his household believed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26201">54</sup> This
was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come
from Judea to Galilee.</p>
