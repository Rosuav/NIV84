<h4>1 Samuel 25</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David, Nabal and Abigail</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7863">1</sup> Now Samuel
died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried
him at his home in Ramah.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then David moved down into the Desert of
Maon.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7863a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7864">2</sup> A certain man in Maon, who had property
there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and
three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7865">3</sup> His name was Nabal and his
wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful
woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his
dealings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7866">4</sup> While
David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7867">5</sup> So he sent ten
young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him
in my name. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7868">6</sup> Say
to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household!
And good health to all that is yours!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7869">7</sup> “‘Now I
hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with
us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at
Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7870">8</sup> Ask your own servants and they will tell
you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a
festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever
you can find for them.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7871">9</sup> When
David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name.
Then they waited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7872">10</sup> Nabal
answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of
Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these
days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7873">11</sup> Why
should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered
for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows
where?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7874">12</sup>
David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they
reported every word. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7875">13</sup> David said to his men, “Put on your
swords!” So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About
four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with
the supplies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7876">14</sup> One of
the servants told Nabal’s wife Abigail: “David sent messengers from
the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults
at them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7877">15</sup> Yet
these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the
whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7878">16</sup> Night and day
they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep
near them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7879">17</sup> Now
think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging
over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man
that no one can talk to him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7880">18</sup>
Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two
skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7880b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of roasted grain, a hundred cakes
of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them
on donkeys. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7881">19</sup>
Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she
did not tell her husband Nabal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7882">20</sup> As she
came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and
his men descending toward her, and she met them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7883">21</sup> David had just said, “It’s
been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the
desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil
for good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7884">22</sup> May
God deal with David,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7884c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> be it
ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who
belong to him!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7885">23</sup> When
Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down
before David with her face to the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7886">24</sup> She fell at his feet and said: “My lord,
let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you;
hear what your servant has to say. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7887">25</sup> May my lord pay no attention to that
wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name is Fool, and
folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the
men my master sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7888">26</sup> “Now
since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from
avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives
and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my
master be like Nabal. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7889">27</sup> And let this gift, which your servant
has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7890">28</sup> Please forgive
your servant’s offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting
dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD’s battles. Let no
wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7891">29</sup> Even though someone is
pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound
securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the
lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a
sling. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7892">30</sup> When the
LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning
him and has appointed him leader over Israel, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7893">31</sup> my master will not have on his
conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having
avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success,
remember your servant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7894">32</sup> David
said to Abigail, “Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has
sent you today to meet me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7895">33</sup> May you be blessed for your good
judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from
avenging myself with my own hands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7896">34</sup> Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the
God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had
not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would
have been left alive by daybreak.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7897">35</sup> Then
David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go
home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your
request.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7898">36</sup> When
Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like
that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told
him nothing until daybreak. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7899">37</sup> Then in the morning, when Nabal was
sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him
and he became like a stone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7900">38</sup> About ten days later, the LORD struck
Nabal and he died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7901">39</sup> When
David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the LORD,
who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with
contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought
Nabal’s wrongdoing down on his own head.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to
become his wife. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7902">40</sup> His servants went to Carmel and said to
Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his
wife.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7903">41</sup> She
bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “Here is your
maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master’s
servants.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7904">42</sup>
Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids,
went with David’s messengers and became his wife. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7905">43</sup> David had also married
Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7906">44</sup> But Saul had given his
daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7906d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> son of Laish, who was from
Gallim.</p>
