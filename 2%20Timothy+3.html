<h4>2 Timothy 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Godlessness in the Last Days</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29839">1</sup> But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29840">2</sup> People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29841">3</sup> without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29842">4</sup> treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29843">5</sup> having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29844">6</sup> They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29845">7</sup> always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29846">8</sup> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth—men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29847">9</sup> But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone. <h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Charge to Timothy</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29848">10</sup> You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29849">11</sup> persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29850">12</sup> In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29851">13</sup> while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29852">14</sup> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29853">15</sup> and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29854">16</sup> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29855">17</sup> so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. </div></body></html>
