<h4>Genesis 6</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Flood</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-139">1</sup> When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-140">2</sup> the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-141">3</sup> Then the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-141a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> man forever, for he is mortal<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-141b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-142">4</sup> The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-143">5</sup> The LORD saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-144">6</sup> The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-145">7</sup> So the LORD said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-146">8</sup> But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-147">9</sup> This is the account of Noah. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-148">10</sup> Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-149">11</sup> Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-150">12</sup> God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-151">13</sup> So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-152">14</sup> So make yourself an ark of cypress<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-152c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-153">15</sup> This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-153d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-154">16</sup> Make a roof for it and finish<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-154e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> the ark to within 18 inches<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-154f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-155">17</sup> I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-156">18</sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-157">19</sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-158">20</sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-159">21</sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-160">22</sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-141a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-141" title="Ir a Genesis 6:3">Genesis 6:3</a> Or <i>My spirit will not remain in</i></li>
