<h4>Nehemiah 8</h4>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12495">1</sup> all the people assembled as one man in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12496">2</sup> So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12497">3</sup> He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12498">4</sup> Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12499">5</sup> Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12500">6</sup> Ezra praised the LORD, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, “Amen! Amen!” Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12501">7</sup> The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12502">8</sup> They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12502a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12503">9</sup> Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, “This day is sacred to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12504">10</sup> Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12505">11</sup> The Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for this is a sacred day. Do not grieve.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12506">12</sup> Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12507">13</sup> On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the Law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12508">14</sup> They found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12509">15</sup> and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make booths”—as it is written.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12509b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12510">16</sup> So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12511">17</sup> The whole company that had returned from exile built booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12512">18</sup> Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-12502a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-12502" title="Ir a Nehemiah 8:8">Nehemiah 8:8</a> Or <i>God, translating it</i></li>
