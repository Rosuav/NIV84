<h4>Isaiah 47</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Fall of Babylon</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18601">1</sup> “Go down, sit in the dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virgin Daughter of Babylon; <br />sit on the ground without a throne, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter of the Babylonians.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18601a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <br />No more will you be called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender or delicate. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18602">2</sup> Take millstones and grind flour; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take off your veil. <br />Lift up your skirts, bare your legs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wade through the streams. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18603">3</sup> Your nakedness will be exposed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your shame uncovered. <br />I will take vengeance; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will spare no one.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18604">4</sup> Our Redeemer—the LORD Almighty is his name— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the Holy One of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18605">5</sup> “Sit in silence, go into darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter of the Babylonians; <br />no more will you be called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queen of kingdoms. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18606">6</sup> I was angry with my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and desecrated my inheritance; <br />I gave them into your hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you showed them no mercy. <br />Even on the aged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you laid a very heavy yoke. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18607">7</sup> You said, ‘I will continue forever— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eternal queen!’ <br />But you did not consider these things <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or reflect on what might happen. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18608">8</sup> “Now then, listen, you wanton creature, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lounging in your security <br />and saying to yourself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I am, and there is none besides me. <br />I will never be a widow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or suffer the loss of children.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18609">9</sup> Both of these will overtake you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a moment, on a single day: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss of children and widowhood. <br />They will come upon you in full measure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in spite of your many sorceries <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all your potent spells. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18610">10</sup> You have trusted in your wickedness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have said, ‘No one sees me.’ <br />Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you say to yourself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I am, and there is none besides me.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18611">11</sup> Disaster will come upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will not know how to conjure it away. <br />A calamity will fall upon you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you cannot ward off with a ransom; <br />a catastrophe you cannot foresee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will suddenly come upon you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18612">12</sup> “Keep on, then, with your magic spells <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with your many sorceries, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which you have labored at since childhood. <br />Perhaps you will succeed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps you will cause terror. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18613">13</sup> All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your astrologers come forward, <br />those stargazers who make predictions month by month, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them save you from what is coming upon you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18614">14</sup> Surely they are like stubble; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fire will burn them up. <br />They cannot even save themselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the power of the flame. <br />Here are no coals to warm anyone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here is no fire to sit by. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18615">15</sup> That is all they can do for you— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these you have labored with <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and trafficked with since childhood. <br />Each of them goes on in his error; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is not one that can save you. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18601a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18601" title="Ir a Isaiah 47:1">Isaiah 47:1</a> Or <i>Chaldeans</i>; also in verse 5</li>
