<h4>Revelation 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Woman and the Dragon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30877">1</sup> A great
and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun,
with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her
head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30878">2</sup> She was
pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30879">3</sup> Then another
sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads
and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30880">4</sup> His tail swept a third of the stars
out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in
front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might
devour her child the moment it was born. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30881">5</sup> She gave birth to a son, a male child,
who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child
was snatched up to God and to his throne. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30882">6</sup> The woman fled into the desert to a
place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for
1,260 days.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30883">7</sup> And
there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the
dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30884">8</sup> But he was not strong
enough, and they lost their place in heaven. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30885">9</sup> The great dragon was hurled down—that
ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole
world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30886">10</sup> Then
I heard a loud voice in heaven say:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now have come the salvation and the power and
the kingdom of our God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the authority of his Christ.<br>
For the accuser of our brothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who accuses them before our God day and
night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been hurled down.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30887">11</sup> They overcame
him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the blood of the Lamb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by the word of their testimony;<br>
they did not love their lives so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to shrink from death.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30888">12</sup> Therefore
rejoice, you heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you who dwell in them!<br>
But woe to the earth and the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the devil has gone down to you!<br>
He is filled with fury,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he knows that his time is short.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30889">13</sup> When
the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the
woman who had given birth to the male child. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30890">14</sup> The woman was given the two wings of
a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her
in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times
and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30891">15</sup> Then from his mouth the serpent
spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away
with the torrent. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30892">16</sup> But the earth helped the woman by
opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had
spewed out of his mouth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30893">17</sup> Then the dragon was enraged at the
woman and went off to make war against the rest of her
offspring—those who obey God’s commandments and hold to the
testimony of Jesus.</p>
