<h4>Deuteronomy 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The One Place of Worship</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5242">1</sup> These are
the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that
the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess—as long
as you live in the land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5243">2</sup> Destroy completely all the places on the
high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree
where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5244">3</sup> Break down their
altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in
the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names
from those places.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5245">4</sup> You
must not worship the LORD your God in their way. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5246">5</sup> But you are to seek the
place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to
put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5247">6</sup> there bring your
burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what
you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the
firstborn of your herds and flocks. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5248">7</sup> There, in the presence of the LORD your
God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in
everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has
blessed you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5249">8</sup> You are
not to do as we do here today, everyone as he sees fit, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5250">9</sup> since you have not yet
reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is
giving you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5251">10</sup> But
you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God
is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all
your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5252">11</sup> Then to the
place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his
Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt
offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all
the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5253">12</sup> And there rejoice before
the LORD your God, you, your sons and daughters, your menservants
and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns, who have no
allotment or inheritance of their own. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5254">13</sup> Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt
offerings anywhere you please. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5255">14</sup> Offer them only at the place the LORD
will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I
command you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5256">15</sup>
Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns
and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or
deer, according to the blessing the LORD your God gives you. Both
the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5257">16</sup> But you must not eat the
blood; pour it out on the ground like water. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5258">17</sup> You must not eat in your own towns
the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil, or the firstborn of
your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your
freewill offerings or special gifts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5259">18</sup> Instead, you are to eat them in the
presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will
choose—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and
maidservants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to
rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand
to. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5260">19</sup> Be careful
not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5261">20</sup> When
the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you,
and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may
eat as much of it as you want. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5262">21</sup> If the place where the LORD your God
chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter
animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have
commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as
you want. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5263">22</sup> Eat
them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean
and the clean may eat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5264">23</sup> But be sure you do not eat the blood,
because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with
the meat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5265">24</sup> You
must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5266">25</sup> Do not eat it,
so that it may go well with you and your children after you,
because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5267">26</sup> But
take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give,
and go to the place the LORD will choose. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5268">27</sup> Present your burnt offerings on the
altar of the LORD your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood
of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your
God, but you may eat the meat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5269">28</sup> Be careful to obey all these regulations
I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your
children after you, because you will be doing what is good and
right in the eyes of the LORD your God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5270">29</sup> The
LORD your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to
invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and
settled in their land, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5271">30</sup> and after they have been destroyed
before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their
gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do
the same.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5272">31</sup> You
must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in
worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the
LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as
sacrifices to their gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5273">32</sup> See
that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from
it.</p>
