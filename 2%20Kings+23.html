<h4>2 Kings 23</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Josiah Renews the Covenant</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10167">1</sup> Then the
king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10168">2</sup> He went up to
the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of
Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the
least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of
the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10169">3</sup> The king
stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the
LORD—to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and
decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the
words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people
pledged themselves to the covenant.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10170">4</sup> The
king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and
the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the
articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He
burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley
and took the ashes to Bethel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10171">5</sup> He did away with the pagan priests
appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places
of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem—those who
burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations
and to all the starry hosts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10172">6</sup> He took the Asherah pole from the temple
of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it
there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the
graves of the common people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10173">7</sup> He also tore down the quarters of the
male shrine prostitutes, which were in the temple of the LORD and
where women did weaving for Asherah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10174">8</sup> Josiah
brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the
high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned
incense. He broke down the shrines<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10174a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> at the
gates—at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the city governor,
which is on the left of the city gate. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10175">9</sup> Although the priests of the high places
did not serve at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate
unleavened bread with their fellow priests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10176">10</sup> He
desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no
one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10176b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> the fire to Molech. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10177">11</sup> He removed from the
entrance to the temple of the LORD the horses that the kings of
Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the
room of an official named Nathan-Melech. Josiah then burned the
chariots dedicated to the sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10178">12</sup> He
pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof
near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in
the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He removed them from
there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron
Valley. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10179">13</sup> The
king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on
the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel
had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for
Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10179c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> the detestable god of the people
of Ammon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10180">14</sup>
Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and
covered the sites with human bones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10181">15</sup> Even
the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat,
who had caused Israel to sin—even that altar and high place he
demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and
burned the Asherah pole also. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10182">16</sup> Then Josiah looked around, and when he
saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones
removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in
accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God
who foretold these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10183">17</sup> The
king asked, “What is that tombstone I see?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men of the city said, “It marks the tomb
of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the
altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10184">18</sup>
“Leave it alone,” he said. “Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So
they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from
Samaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10185">19</sup> Just
as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed and defiled all the
shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in
the towns of Samaria that had provoked the LORD to anger.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10186">20</sup> Josiah
slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and
burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10187">21</sup> The
king gave this order to all the people: “Celebrate the Passover to
the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10188">22</sup> Not since the
days of the judges who led Israel, nor throughout the days of the
kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, had any such Passover been
observed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10189">23</sup> But
in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated
to the LORD in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10190">24</sup>
Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the
household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen
in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of
the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered
in the temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10191">25</sup> Neither before nor after Josiah was
there a king like him who turned to the LORD as he did—with all his
heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in
accordance with all the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10192">26</sup>
Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of his
fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that
Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10193">27</sup> So the LORD said, “I will remove
Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject
Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said,
‘There shall my Name be.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10193d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10194">28</sup> As
for the other events of Josiah’s reign, and all he did, are they
not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10195">29</sup> While
Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the
Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched
out to meet him in battle, but Neco faced him and killed him at
Megiddo. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10196">30</sup>
Josiah’s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to
Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the
land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king
in place of his father.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoahaz King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10197">31</sup> Jehoahaz
was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10198">32</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD,
just as his fathers had done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10199">33</sup> Pharaoh Neco put him in chains at
Riblah in the land of Hamath<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10199e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> so
that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a
levy of a hundred talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10199f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of
silver and a talent<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10199g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of
gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10200">34</sup> Pharaoh
Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah
and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and
carried him off to Egypt, and there he died. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10201">35</sup> Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the
silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land
and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land
according to their assessments.
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoiakim King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10202">36</sup>
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah
daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10203">37</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of the
LORD, just as his fathers had done.
