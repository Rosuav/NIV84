<p><h4>Isaiah 64</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18887">1</sup> Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the mountains would tremble before you! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18888">2</sup> As when fire sets twigs ablaze <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and causes water to boil, <br />come down to make your name known to your enemies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cause the nations to quake before you! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18889">3</sup> For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you came down, and the mountains trembled before you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18890">4</sup> Since ancient times no one has heard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no ear has perceived, <br />no eye has seen any God besides you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18891">5</sup> You come to the help of those who gladly do right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who remember your ways. <br />But when we continued to sin against them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were angry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can we be saved? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18892">6</sup> All of us have become like one who is unclean, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; <br />we all shrivel up like a leaf, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like the wind our sins sweep us away. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18893">7</sup> No one calls on your name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or strives to lay hold of you; <br />for you have hidden your face from us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made us waste away because of our sins. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18894">8</sup> Yet, O LORD, you are our Father. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the clay, you are the potter; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are all the work of your hand. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18895">9</sup> Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not remember our sins forever. <br />Oh, look upon us, we pray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for we are all your people. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18896">10</sup> Your sacred cities have become a desert; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even Zion is a desert, Jerusalem a desolation. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18897">11</sup> Our holy and glorious temple, where our fathers praised you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been burned with fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all that we treasured lies in ruins. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18898">12</sup> After all this, O LORD, will you hold yourself back? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure? </p></div></body></html>
