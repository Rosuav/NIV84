<p><h4>Zechariah 11</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23030">1</sup> Open your doors, O Lebanon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that fire may devour your cedars! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23031">2</sup> Wail, O pine tree, for the cedar has fallen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stately trees are ruined! <br />Wail, oaks of Bashan; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dense forest has been cut down! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23032">3</sup> Listen to the wail of the shepherds; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their rich pastures are destroyed! <br />Listen to the roar of the lions; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined! <h5 class="passage-header">Two Shepherds</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23033">4</sup> This is what the LORD my God says: “Pasture the flock marked for slaughter. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23034">5</sup> Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the LORD, I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23035">6</sup> For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the LORD. “I will hand everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will oppress the land, and I will not rescue them from their hands.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23036">7</sup> So I pastured the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I pastured the flock. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23037">8</sup> In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23038">9</sup> and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23039">10</sup> Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23040">11</sup> It was revoked on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23041">12</sup> I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23042">13</sup> And the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they priced me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD to the potter. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23043">14</sup> Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23044">15</sup> Then the LORD said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23045">16</sup> For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hoofs. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23046">17</sup> “Woe to the worthless shepherd, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who deserts the flock! <br />May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May his arm be completely withered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his right eye totally blinded!” </p></div></body></html>
