<h4>Job 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Job</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13240">1</sup> Then Job
replied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13241">2</sup> “I
have heard many things like these;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miserable comforters are you all!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13242">3</sup> Will your
long-winded speeches never end?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ails you that you keep on arguing?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13243">4</sup> I also could
speak like you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you were in my place;<br>
I could make fine speeches against you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shake my head at you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13244">5</sup> But my mouth
would encourage you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13245">6</sup> “Yet
if I speak, my pain is not relieved;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if I refrain, it does not go away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13246">7</sup> Surely, O God,
you have worn me out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have devastated my entire household.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13247">8</sup> You have bound
me—and it has become a witness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my gauntness rises up and testifies against
me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13248">9</sup> God assails me
and tears me in his anger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gnashes his teeth at me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13249">10</sup> Men open their
mouths to jeer at me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they strike my cheek in scorn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and unite together against me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13250">11</sup> God has turned
me over to evil men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thrown me into the clutches of the
wicked.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13251">12</sup> All was well
with me, but he shattered me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he seized me by the neck and crushed me.<br>
He has made me his target;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13252">13</sup> his
archers surround me.<br>
Without pity, he pierces my kidneys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spills my gall on the ground.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13253">14</sup> Again and
again he bursts upon me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he rushes at me like a warrior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13254">15</sup> “I
have sewed sackcloth over my skin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and buried my brow in the dust.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13255">16</sup> My face is red
with weeping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deep shadows ring my eyes;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13256">17</sup> yet my hands
have been free of violence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my prayer is pure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13257">18</sup> “O
earth, do not cover my blood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may my cry never be laid to rest!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13258">19</sup> Even now my
witness is in heaven;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my advocate is on high.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13259">20</sup> My intercessor
is my friend<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13259a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as my eyes pour out tears to God;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13260">21</sup> on behalf of a
man he pleads with God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a man pleads for his friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13261">22</sup> “Only
a few years will pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before I go on the journey of no return.</p>
