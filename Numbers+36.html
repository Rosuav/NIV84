<h4>Numbers 36</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Inheritance of Zelophehad’s
Daughters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4881">1</sup> The family
heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who
were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke
before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4882">2</sup> They said, “When
the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to
the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of
our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4883">3</sup> Now suppose they marry men from other
Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our
ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry
into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken
away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4884">4</sup> When the
Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be
added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their
property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our
forefathers.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4885">5</sup> Then at
the LORD’s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: “What
the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4886">6</sup> This is what the
LORD commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone
they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their
father. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4887">7</sup> No
inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every
Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his
forefathers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4888">8</sup>
Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry
someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will
possess the inheritance of his fathers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4889">9</sup> No inheritance may pass from tribe to
tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it
inherits.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4890">10</sup> So
Zelophehad’s daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4891">11</sup> Zelophehad’s
daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah—married their
cousins on their father’s side. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4892">12</sup> They married within the clans of the
descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance
remained in their father’s clan and tribe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4893">13</sup> These
are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the
Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from
Jericho.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4893a" title=
