<h4>1 Corinthians 15</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection of Christ</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28704">1</sup> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28705">2</sup> By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28706">3</sup> For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28706a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28707">4</sup> that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28708">5</sup> and that he appeared to Peter,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28708b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and then to the Twelve. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28709">6</sup> After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28710">7</sup> Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28711">8</sup> and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28712">9</sup> For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28713">10</sup> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28714">11</sup> Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. <h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection of the Dead</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28715">12</sup> But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28716">13</sup> If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28717">14</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28718">15</sup> More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28719">16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28720">17</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28721">18</sup> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28722">19</sup> If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28723">20</sup> But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28724">21</sup> For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28725">22</sup> For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28726">23</sup> But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28727">24</sup> Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28728">25</sup> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28729">26</sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28730">27</sup> For he “has put everything under his feet.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28730c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28731">28</sup> When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28732">29</sup> Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28733">30</sup> And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28734">31</sup> I die every day—I mean that, brothers—just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28735">32</sup> If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let us eat and drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for tomorrow we die.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28735d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28736">33</sup> Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28737">34</sup> Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame. <h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection Body</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28738">35</sup> But someone may ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28739">36</sup> How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28740">37</sup> When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28741">38</sup> But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28742">39</sup> All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28743">40</sup> There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28744">41</sup> The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28745">42</sup> So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28746">43</sup> it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28747">44</sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28748">45</sup> So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28748e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28749">46</sup> The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28750">47</sup> The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28751">48</sup> As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28752">49</sup> And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28752f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> bear the likeness of the man from heaven. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28753">50</sup> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28754">51</sup> Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28755">52</sup> in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28756">53</sup> For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28757">54</sup> When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28757g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28758">55</sup> “Where, O death, is your victory? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, O death, is your sting?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28758h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28759">56</sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28760">57</sup> But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28761">58</sup> Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28706a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28706" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</a> Or <i>you at the first</i></li>
