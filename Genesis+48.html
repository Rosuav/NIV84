<h4>Genesis 48</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Manasseh and Ephraim</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1453">1</sup> Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1454">2</sup> When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1455">3</sup> Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1455a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1456">4</sup> and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1457">5</sup> “Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1458">6</sup> Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1459">7</sup> As I was returning from Paddan,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1459b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1460">8</sup> When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1461">9</sup> “They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1462">10</sup> Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1463">11</sup> Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1464">12</sup> Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1465">13</sup> And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1466">14</sup> But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1467">15</sup> Then he blessed Joseph and said, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“May the God before whom my fathers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham and Isaac walked, <br />the God who has been my shepherd <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my life to this day, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1468">16</sup> the Angel who has delivered me from all harm <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—may he bless these boys. <br />May they be called by my name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, <br />and may they increase greatly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the earth.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1469">17</sup> When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1470">18</sup> Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1471">19</sup> But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1472">20</sup> He blessed them that day and said, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In your<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1472c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> name will Israel pronounce this blessing: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1473">21</sup> Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1473d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and take you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1473e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> back to the land of your<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1473f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> fathers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1474">22</sup> And to you, as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1474g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-1455a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-1455" title="Ir a Genesis 48:3">Genesis 48:3</a> Hebrew <i>El-Shaddai</i></li>
