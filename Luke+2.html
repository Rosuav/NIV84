<p><h4>Luke 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24967">1</sup> In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24968">2</sup> (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24969">3</sup> And everyone went to his own town to register. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24970">4</sup> So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24971">5</sup> He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24972">6</sup> While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24973">7</sup> and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. <h5 class="passage-header">The Shepherds and the Angels</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24974">8</sup> And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24975">9</sup> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24976">10</sup> But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24977">11</sup> Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24977a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24978">12</sup> This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24979">13</sup> Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24980">14</sup> “Glory to God in the highest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24981">15</sup> When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24982">16</sup> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24983">17</sup> When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24984">18</sup> and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24985">19</sup> But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24986">20</sup> The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Presented in the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24987">21</sup> On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24988">22</sup> When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24989">23</sup> (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24989b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>), <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24990">24</sup> and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24990c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24991">25</sup> Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24992">26</sup> It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24993">27</sup> Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24994">28</sup> Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24995">29</sup> “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you now dismiss<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24995d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> your servant in peace. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24996">30</sup> For my eyes have seen your salvation, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24997">31</sup> which you have prepared in the sight of all people, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24998">32</sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for glory to your people Israel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24999">33</sup> The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25000">34</sup> Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25001">35</sup> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25002">36</sup> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25003">37</sup> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25003e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25004">38</sup> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25005">39</sup> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25006">40</sup> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. <h5 class="passage-header">The Boy Jesus at the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25007">41</sup> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25008">42</sup> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25009">43</sup> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25010">44</sup> Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25011">45</sup> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25012">46</sup> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25013">47</sup> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25014">48</sup> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25015">49</sup> “Why were you searching for me?”</font> he asked. <font class='woj'>“Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25016">50</sup> But they did not understand what he was saying to them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25017">51</sup> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25018">52</sup> And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24977a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24977" title="Go to Luke 2:11">Luke 2:11</a> Or <i>Messiah.</i> “The Christ” (Greek) and “the Messiah” (Hebrew) both mean “the Anointed One”; also in verse 26.</li>
