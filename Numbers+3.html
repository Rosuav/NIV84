<h4>Numbers 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Levites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3694">1</sup> This is
the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD
talked with Moses on Mount Sinai.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3695">2</sup> The
names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu,
Eleazar and Ithamar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3696">3</sup> Those were the names of Aaron’s sons, the
anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3697">4</sup> Nadab and Abihu,
however, fell dead before the LORD when they made an offering with
unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no
sons; so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the
lifetime of their father Aaron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3698">5</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3699">6</sup> “Bring the tribe of Levi and present them
to Aaron the priest to assist him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3700">7</sup> They are to perform duties for him and
for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of
the tabernacle. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3701">8</sup>
They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of
Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the
work of the tabernacle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3702">9</sup> Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons;
they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to
him.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3702a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3703">10</sup> Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as
priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to
death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3704">11</sup> The
LORD also said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3705">12</sup> “I have taken the Levites from among the
Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite
woman. The Levites are mine, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3706">13</sup> for all the firstborn are mine. When I
struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself
every firstborn in Israel, whether man or animal. They are to be
mine. I am the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3707">14</sup> The
LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3708">15</sup> “Count the Levites by their families
and clans. Count every male a month old or more.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3709">16</sup> So Moses counted them, as
he was commanded by the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3710">17</sup> These
were the names of the sons of Levi:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3711">18</sup> These
were the names of the Gershonite clans:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libni and Shimei.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3712">19</sup> The
Kohathite clans:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3713">20</sup> The
Merarite clans:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahli and Mushi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the Levite clans, according to
their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3714">21</sup> To
Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these
were the Gershonite clans. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3715">22</sup> The number of all the males a month old
or more who were counted was 7,500. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3716">23</sup> The Gershonite clans were to camp on the
west, behind the tabernacle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3717">24</sup> The leader of the families of the
Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3718">25</sup> At the Tent of Meeting the Gershonites
were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its
coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3719">26</sup> the curtains of
the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard
surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything
related to their use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3720">27</sup> To
Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites
and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3721">28</sup> The number of all the
males a month old or more was 8,600.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3721b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> The
Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3722">29</sup> The Kohathite
clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3723">30</sup> The leader of the families
of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3724">31</sup> They were responsible for
the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the
articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and
everything related to their use. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3725">32</sup> The chief leader of the Levites was
Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who
were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3726">33</sup> To
Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these
were the Merarite clans. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3727">34</sup> The number of all the males a month old
or more who were counted was 6,200. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3728">35</sup> The leader of the families of the
Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the
north side of the tabernacle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3729">36</sup> The Merarites were appointed to take
care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases,
all its equipment, and everything related to their use, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3730">37</sup> as well as the posts of
the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and
ropes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3731">38</sup> Moses
and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle,
toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of Meeting. They were
responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the
Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put
to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3732">39</sup> The
total number of Levites counted at the LORD’s command by Moses and
Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or
more, was 22,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3733">40</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn Israelite males who
are a month old or more and make a list of their names. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3734">41</sup> Take the Levites for me in
place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of
the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the
Israelites. I am the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3735">42</sup> So
Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD
commanded him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3736">43</sup>
The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by
name, was 22,273.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3737">44</sup> The
LORD also said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3738">45</sup> “Take the Levites in place of all the
firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of
their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3739">46</sup> To redeem the
273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3740">47</sup> collect five
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3740c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> for each one, according to the
sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3741">48</sup> Give the money for the redemption of
the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3742">49</sup> So
Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the
number redeemed by the Levites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3743">50</sup> From the firstborn of the Israelites he
collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3743d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> according to the sanctuary shekel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3744">51</sup> Moses gave the
redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the
word of the LORD.</p>
