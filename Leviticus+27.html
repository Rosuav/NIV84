<h4>Leviticus 27</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Redeeming What Is the LORD’s</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3572">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3573">2</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate persons to the LORD by giving equivalent values, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3574">3</sup> set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3574a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3574b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3575">4</sup> and if it is a female, set her value at thirty shekels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3575c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3576">5</sup> If it is a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3576d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and of a female at ten shekels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3576e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3577">6</sup> If it is a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3577f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of silver and that of a female at three shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3577g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of silver. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3578">7</sup> If it is a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3578h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> and of a female at ten shekels. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3579">8</sup> If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, he is to present the person to the priest, who will set the value for him according to what the man making the vow can afford. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3580">9</sup> “‘If what he vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, such an animal given to the LORD becomes holy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3581">10</sup> He must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if he should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3582">11</sup> If what he vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD—the animal must be presented to the priest, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3583">12</sup> who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3584">13</sup> If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3585">14</sup> “‘If a man dedicates his house as something holy to the LORD, the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3586">15</sup> If the man who dedicates his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become his. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3587">16</sup> “‘If a man dedicates to the LORD part of his family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3587i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> of barley seed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3588">17</sup> If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3589">18</sup> But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3590">19</sup> If the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become his. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3591">20</sup> If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3592">21</sup> When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it will become the property of the priests.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3592j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3593">22</sup> “‘If a man dedicates to the LORD a field he has bought, which is not part of his family land, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3594">23</sup> the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as something holy to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3595">24</sup> In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom he bought it, the one whose land it was. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3596">25</sup> Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3597">26</sup> “‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the LORD; whether an ox<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3597k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> or a sheep, it is the LORD’s. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3598">27</sup> If it is one of the unclean animals, he may buy it back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If he does not redeem it, it is to be sold at its set value. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3599">28</sup> “‘But nothing that a man owns and devotes<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3599l" title="Vea nota al pie l">l</a>]</sup> to the LORD—whether man or animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3600">29</sup> “‘No person devoted to destruction<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3600m" title="Vea nota al pie m">m</a>]</sup> may be ransomed; he must be put to death. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3601">30</sup> “‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3602">31</sup> If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth of the value to it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3603">32</sup> The entire tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3604">33</sup> He must not pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3605">34</sup> These are the commands the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-3574a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-3574" title="Ir a Leviticus 27:3">Leviticus 27:3</a> That is, about 1 1/4 pounds (about 0.6 kilogram); also in verse 16</li>
