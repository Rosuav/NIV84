<p><h4>Luke 24</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25983">1</sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25984">2</sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25985">3</sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25986">4</sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25987">5</sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25988">6</sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25989">7</sup> ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’</font> ” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25990">8</sup> Then they remembered his words. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25991">9</sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25992">10</sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25993">11</sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25994">12</sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <h5 class="passage-header">On the Road to Emmaus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25995">13</sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25995a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> from Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25996">14</sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25997">15</sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25998">16</sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25999">17</sup> He asked them, <font class='woj'>“What are you discussing together as you walk along?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood still, their faces downcast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26000">18</sup> One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26001">19</sup> “What things?”</font> he asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26002">20</sup> The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26003">21</sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26004">22</sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26005">23</sup> but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26006">24</sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26007">25</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26008">26</sup> Did not the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26008b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26009">27</sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26010">28</sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26011">29</sup> But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26012">30</sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26013">31</sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26014">32</sup> They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26015">33</sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26016">34</sup> and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26017">35</sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Appears to the Disciples</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26018">36</sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, <font class='woj'>“Peace be with you.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26019">37</sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26020">38</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26021">39</sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26022">40</sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26023">41</sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Do you have anything here to eat?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26024">42</sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26025">43</sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26026">44</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26027">45</sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26028">46</sup> He told them, <font class='woj'>“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26029">47</sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26030">48</sup> You are witnesses of these things.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26031">49</sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Ascension</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26032">50</sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26033">51</sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26034">52</sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26035">53</sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25995a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25995" title="Go to Luke 24:13">Luke 24:13</a> Greek <i>sixty stadia</i> (about 11 kilometers)</li>
