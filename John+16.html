I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Work of the Holy Spirit</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26721">5</sup> “Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26722">6</sup> Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26723">7</sup> But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26724">8</sup> When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26724a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment:</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26725">9</sup> in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me;</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26726">10</sup> in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26727">11</sup> and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26728">12</sup> “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26729">13</sup> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth.

We don’t understand what he is saying.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26735">19</sup> Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26736">20</sup> I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26737">21</sup> A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26738">22</sup> So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26739">23</sup> In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26740">24</sup> Until now you have not asked for anything in my name.

I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26743">27</sup> No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26744">28</sup> I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26745">29</sup> Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26746">30</sup> Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions.
