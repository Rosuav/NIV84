<h4>1 Samuel 17</h4><h5 class="passage-header">David and Goliath</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7620">1</sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7621">2</sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7622">3</sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7623">4</sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7623a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> tall. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7624">5</sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7624b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7625">6</sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7626">7</sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7626c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> His shield bearer went ahead of him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7627">8</sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7628">9</sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7629">10</sup> Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7630">11</sup> On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7631">12</sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7632">13</sup> Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7633">14</sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7634">15</sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7635">16</sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7636">17</sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7636d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7637">18</sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7637e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7637f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> from them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7638">19</sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7639">20</sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7640">21</sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7641">22</sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7642">23</sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7643">24</sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7644">25</sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father’s family from taxes in Israel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7645">26</sup> David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7646">27</sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7647">28</sup> When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7648">29</sup> “Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7649">30</sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7650">31</sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7651">32</sup> David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7652">33</sup> Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7653">34</sup> But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7654">35</sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7655">36</sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7656">37</sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7657">38</sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7658">39</sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7659">40</sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7660">41</sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7661">42</sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7662">43</sup> He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7663">44</sup> “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7664">45</sup> David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7665">46</sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7666">47</sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7667">48</sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7668">49</sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7669">50</sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7670">51</sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7671">52</sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7671g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7672">53</sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7673">54</sup> David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7674">55</sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abner replied, “As surely as you live, O king, I don’t know.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7675">56</sup> The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7676">57</sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7677">58</sup> “Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-7623a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-7623" title="Ir a 1 Samuel 17:4">1 Samuel 17:4</a> Hebrew <i>was six cubits and a span</i> (about 3 meters)</li>
