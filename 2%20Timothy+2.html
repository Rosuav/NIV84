<h4>2 Timothy 2</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29813">1</sup> You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29814">2</sup> And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29815">3</sup> Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29816">4</sup> No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs—he wants to please his commanding officer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29817">5</sup> Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor’s crown unless he competes according to the rules. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29818">6</sup> The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29819">7</sup> Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29820">8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29821">9</sup> for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29822">10</sup> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29823">11</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we died with him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also live with him; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29824">12</sup> if we endure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also reign with him. <br />If we disown him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will also disown us; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29825">13</sup> if we are faithless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will remain faithful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he cannot disown himself. <h5 class="passage-header">A Workman Approved by God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29826">14</sup> Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29827">15</sup> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29828">16</sup> Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29829">17</sup> Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29830">18</sup> who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29831">19</sup> Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29831a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29832">20</sup> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29833">21</sup> If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29834">22</sup> Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29835">23</sup> Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29836">24</sup> And the Lord’s servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29837">25</sup> Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29838">26</sup> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29831a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29831" title="Ir a 2 Timothy 2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</a> Num. 16:5 (see Septuagint)</li>
