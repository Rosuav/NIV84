<h4>Jeremiah 4</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19029">1</sup> “If
you will return, O Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return to me,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
“If you put your detestable idols out of my sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no longer go astray,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19030">2</sup> and if in a
truthful, just and righteous way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’<br>
then the nations will be blessed by him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in him they will glory.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19031">3</sup> This
is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Break up your unplowed ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not sow among thorns.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19032">4</sup> Circumcise
yourselves to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcise your hearts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem,<br>
or my wrath will break out and burn like fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the evil you have done—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn with no one to quench it.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Disaster From the North</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19033">5</sup> “Announce
in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’<br>
Cry aloud and say:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Gather together!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us flee to the fortified cities!’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19034">6</sup> Raise the
signal to go to Zion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flee for safety without delay!<br>
For I am bringing disaster from the north,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even terrible destruction.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19035">7</sup> A lion
has come out of his lair;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a destroyer of nations has set out.<br>
He has left his place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to lay waste your land.<br>
Your towns will lie in ruins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without inhabitant.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19036">8</sup> So put on
sackcloth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lament and wail,<br>
for the fierce anger of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not turned away from us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19037">9</sup> “In
that day,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“the king and the officials will lose heart,<br>
the priests will be horrified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the prophets will be appalled.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19038">10</sup> Then
I said, “Ah, Sovereign LORD, how completely you have deceived this
people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the
sword is at our throats.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19039">11</sup> At
that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind
from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but
not to winnow or cleanse; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19040">12</sup> a wind too strong for that comes from
me.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19040a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Now I pronounce my judgments against
them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19041">13</sup> Look!
He advances like the clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his chariots come like a whirlwind,<br>
his horses are swifter than eagles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to us! We are ruined!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19042">14</sup> O Jerusalem,
wash the evil from your heart and be saved.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19043">15</sup> A voice is
announcing from Dan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proclaiming disaster from the hills of
Ephraim.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19044">16</sup> “Tell this to
the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proclaim it to Jerusalem:<br>
‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raising a war cry against the cities of
Judah.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19045">17</sup> They surround
her like men guarding a field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because she has rebelled against me,’”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19046">18</sup> “Your own
conduct and actions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have brought this upon you.<br>
This is your punishment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How bitter it is!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it pierces to the heart!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19047">19</sup> Oh,
my anguish, my anguish!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I writhe in pain.<br>
Oh, the agony of my heart!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart pounds within me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot keep silent.<br>
For I have heard the sound of the trumpet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the battle cry.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19048">20</sup> Disaster
follows disaster;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole land lies in ruins.<br>
In an instant my tents are destroyed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my shelter in a moment.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19049">21</sup> How long must
I see the battle standard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19050">22</sup> “My
people are fools;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not know me.<br>
They are senseless children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have no understanding.<br>
They are skilled in doing evil;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they know not how to do good.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19051">23</sup> I
looked at the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it was formless and empty;<br>
and at the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their light was gone.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19052">24</sup> I looked at
the mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were quaking;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the hills were swaying.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19053">25</sup> I looked, and
there were no people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every bird in the sky had flown away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19054">26</sup> I looked, and
the fruitful land was a desert;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all its towns lay in ruins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the LORD, before his fierce anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19055">27</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The whole land will be ruined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though I will not destroy it completely.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19056">28</sup> Therefore the
earth will mourn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heavens above grow dark,<br>
because I have spoken and will not relent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided and will not turn back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19057">29</sup> At
the sound of horsemen and archers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every town takes to flight.<br>
Some go into the thickets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some climb up among the rocks.<br>
All the towns are deserted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one lives in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19058">30</sup> What
are you doing, O devastated one?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dress yourself in scarlet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put on jewels of gold?<br>
Why shade your eyes with paint?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You adorn yourself in vain.<br>
Your lovers despise you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they seek your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19059">31</sup> I
hear a cry as of a woman in labor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a groan as of one bearing her first child—<br>
the cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping for breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretching out her hands and saying,<br>
“Alas! I am fainting;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my life is given over to murderers.”</p>
