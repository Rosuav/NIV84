<h4>Deuteronomy 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Worshiping Other Gods</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5274">1</sup> If a
prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and
announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5275">2</sup> and if the sign or wonder of which he
has spoken takes place, and he says, “Let us follow other gods”
(gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5276">3</sup> you must not listen to the
words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you
to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all
your soul. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5277">4</sup> It is
the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep
his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5278">5</sup> That prophet or
dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against
the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you
from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the
LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from
among you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5279">6</sup> If your
very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or
your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and
worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your fathers have
known, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5280">7</sup> gods of
the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the
land to the other), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5281">8</sup> do not yield to him or listen to him.
Show him no pity. Do not spare him or shield him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5282">9</sup> You must certainly put him
to death. Your hand must be the first in putting him to death, and
then the hands of all the people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5283">10</sup> Stone him to death, because he tried to
turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt,
out of the land of slavery. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5284">11</sup> Then all Israel will hear and be afraid,
and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5285">12</sup> If you
hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you
to live in <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5286">13</sup> that
wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their
town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you
have not known), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5287">14</sup> then you must inquire, probe and
investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved
that this detestable thing has been done among you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5288">15</sup> you must certainly put to
the sword all who live in that town. Destroy it
completely,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5288a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> both its people and its
livestock. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5289">16</sup>
Gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public
square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole
burnt offering to the LORD your God. It is to remain a ruin
forever, never to be rebuilt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5290">17</sup> None of those condemned
things<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5290b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> shall be found in your hands, so
that the LORD will turn from his fierce anger; he will show you
mercy, have compassion on you, and increase your numbers, as he
promised on oath to your forefathers, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5291">18</sup> because you obey the LORD your God,
keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what
is right in his eyes.</p>
