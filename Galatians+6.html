<h4>Galatians 6</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Doing Good to All</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29174">1</sup> Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29175">2</sup> Carry each otherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29176">3</sup> If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29177">4</sup> Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29178">5</sup> for each one should carry his own load. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29179">6</sup> Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29180">7</sup> Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29181">8</sup> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29181a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29182">9</sup> Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29183">10</sup> Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. <h5 class="passage-header">Not Circumcision but a New Creation</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29184">11</sup> See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29185">12</sup> Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29186">13</sup> Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29187">14</sup> May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29187b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29188">15</sup> Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29189">16</sup> Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29190">17</sup> Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29191">18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29181a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29181" title="Ir a Galatians 6:8">Galatians 6:8</a> Or <i>his flesh, from the flesh</i></li>
