<p><h4>Mark 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24498">1</sup> During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24499">2</sup> “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24500">3</sup> If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24501">4</sup> His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24502">5</sup> “How many loaves do you have?”</font> Jesus asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seven,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24503">6</sup> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24504">7</sup> They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24505">8</sup> The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24506">9</sup> About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24507">10</sup> he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24508">11</sup> The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24509">12</sup> He sighed deeply and said, <font class='woj'>“Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24510">13</sup> Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side. <h5 class="passage-header">The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24511">14</sup> The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24512">15</sup> “Be careful,”</font> Jesus warned them. <font class='woj'>“Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24513">16</sup> They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24514">17</sup> Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: <font class='woj'>“Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24515">18</sup> Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24516">19</sup> When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Twelve,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24517">20</sup> “And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answered, “Seven.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24518">21</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“Do you still not understand?”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Healing of a Blind Man at Bethsaida</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24519">22</sup> They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24520">23</sup> He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, <font class='woj'>“Do you see anything?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24521">24</sup> He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24522">25</sup> Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24523">26</sup> Jesus sent him home, saying, <font class='woj'>“Don’t go into the village.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24523a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Peter’s Confession of Christ</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24524">27</sup> Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Who do people say I am?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24525">28</sup> They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24526">29</sup> “But what about you?”</font> he asked. <font class='woj'>“Who do you say I am?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter answered, “You are the Christ.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24526b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24527">30</sup> Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24528">31</sup> He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24529">32</sup> He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24530">33</sup> But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. <font class='woj'>“Get behind me, Satan!”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24531">34</sup> Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: <font class='woj'>“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24532">35</sup> For whoever wants to save his life<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24532c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24533">36</sup> What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24534">37</sup> Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24535">38</sup> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-24523a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-24523" title="Go to Mark 8:26">Mark 8:26</a> Some manuscripts <i>Don’t go and tell anyone in the village</i></li>
