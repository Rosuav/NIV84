<h4>Revelation 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Two Witnesses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30858">1</sup> I was
given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the
temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30859">2</sup> But exclude the
outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the
Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30860">3</sup> And I will give
power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days,
clothed in sackcloth.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30861">4</sup> These are the two olive trees and the
two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30862">5</sup> If anyone tries to harm
them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This
is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30863">6</sup> These men have power to
shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are
prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and
to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they
want.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30864">7</sup> Now
when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up
from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30865">8</sup> Their bodies
will lie in the street of the great city, which is figuratively
called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30866">9</sup> For three and a
half days men from every people, tribe, language and nation will
gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30867">10</sup> The inhabitants of the earth will
gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts,
because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the
earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30868">11</sup> But
after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered
them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30869">12</sup> Then
they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.”
And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked
on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30870">13</sup> At
that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the
city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the
earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the
God of heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30871">14</sup> The
second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Seventh Trumpet</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30872">15</sup> The
seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in
heaven, which said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The kingdom of the world has become the
kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will reign for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30873">16</sup> And
the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before
God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30874">17</sup> saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the One who is and who was,<br>
because you have taken your great power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have begun to reign.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30875">18</sup> The nations
were angry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your wrath has come.<br>
The time has come for judging the dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for rewarding your servants the prophets<br>
and your saints and those who reverence your name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both small and great—<br>
and for destroying those who destroy the earth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30876">19</sup> Then
God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen
the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning,
rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great
hailstorm.</p>
