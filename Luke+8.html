<p><h4>Luke 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Sower</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25239">1</sup> After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25240">2</sup> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25241">3</sup> Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25242">4</sup> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25243">5</sup> “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25244">6</sup> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25245">7</sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25246">8</sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, he called out, <font class='woj'>“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25247">9</sup> His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25248">10</sup> He said, <font class='woj'>“The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘though seeing, they may not see;</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>though hearing, they may not understand.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25248a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25249">11</sup> “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25250">12</sup> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25251">13</sup> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25252">14</sup> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25253">15</sup> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">A Lamp on a Stand</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25254">16</sup> “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25255">17</sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25256">18</sup> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25257">19</sup> Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25258">20</sup> Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25259">21</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Calms the Storm</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25260">22</sup> One day Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.”</font> So they got into a boat and set out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25261">23</sup> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25262">24</sup> The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25263">25</sup> “Where is your faith?”</font> he asked his disciples. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Healing of a Demon-possessed Man</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25264">26</sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25264b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25265">27</sup> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25266">28</sup> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25267">29</sup> For Jesus had commanded the evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25267c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25268">30</sup> Jesus asked him, <font class='woj'>“What is your name?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25269">31</sup> And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25270">32</sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25271">33</sup> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25272">34</sup> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25273">35</sup> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25274">36</sup> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25275">37</sup> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25276">38</sup> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25277">39</sup> “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.”</font> So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. <h5 class="passage-header">A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25278">40</sup> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25279">41</sup> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25280">42</sup> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25281">43</sup> And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25281d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> but no one could heal her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25282">44</sup> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25283">45</sup> “Who touched me?”</font> Jesus asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25284">46</sup> But Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25285">47</sup> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25286">48</sup> Then he said to her, <font class='woj'>“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25287">49</sup> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher any more.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25288">50</sup> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, <font class='woj'>“Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25289">51</sup> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25290">52</sup> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. <font class='woj'>“Stop wailing,”</font> Jesus said. <font class='woj'>“She is not dead but asleep.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25291">53</sup> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25292">54</sup> But he took her by the hand and said, <font class='woj'>“My child, get up!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25293">55</sup> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25294">56</sup> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25248a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25248" title="Go to Luke 8:10">Luke 8:10</a> Isaiah 6:9</li>
