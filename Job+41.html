<h4>Job 41</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13890">1</sup> “Can
you pull in the leviathan<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-13890a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> with a
fishhook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or tie down his tongue with a rope?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13891">2</sup> Can you put a
cord through his nose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pierce his jaw with a hook?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13892">3</sup> Will he keep
begging you for mercy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he speak to you with gentle words?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13893">4</sup> Will he make an
agreement with you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you to take him as your slave for life?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13894">5</sup> Can you make a
pet of him like a bird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or put him on a leash for your girls?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13895">6</sup> Will traders
barter for him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they divide him up among the merchants?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13896">7</sup> Can you fill
his hide with harpoons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or his head with fishing spears?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13897">8</sup> If you lay a
hand on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will remember the struggle and never do it
again!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13898">9</sup> Any hope of
subduing him is false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mere sight of him is overpowering.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13899">10</sup> No one is
fierce enough to rouse him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who then is able to stand against me?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13900">11</sup> Who has a
claim against me that I must pay?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything under heaven belongs to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13901">12</sup> “I
will not fail to speak of his limbs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his strength and his graceful form.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13902">13</sup> Who can strip
off his outer coat?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would approach him with a bridle?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13903">14</sup> Who dares open
the doors of his mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ringed about with his fearsome teeth?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13904">15</sup> His back
has<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13904b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> rows of shields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tightly sealed together;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13905">16</sup> each is so
close to the next<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that no air can pass between.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13906">17</sup> They are
joined fast to one another;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cling together and cannot be parted.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13907">18</sup> His snorting
throws out flashes of light;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his eyes are like the rays of dawn.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13908">19</sup> Firebrands
stream from his mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sparks of fire shoot out.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13909">20</sup> Smoke pours
from his nostrils<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13910">21</sup> His breath
sets coals ablaze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flames dart from his mouth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13911">22</sup> Strength
resides in his neck;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dismay goes before him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13912">23</sup> The folds of
his flesh are tightly joined;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are firm and immovable.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13913">24</sup> His chest is
hard as rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard as a lower millstone.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13914">25</sup> When he rises
up, the mighty are terrified;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they retreat before his thrashing.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13915">26</sup> The sword that
reaches him has no effect,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does the spear or the dart or the
javelin.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13916">27</sup> Iron he treats
like straw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bronze like rotten wood.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13917">28</sup> Arrows do not
make him flee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slingstones are like chaff to him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13918">29</sup> A club seems
to him but a piece of straw;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he laughs at the rattling of the lance.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13919">30</sup> His undersides
are jagged potsherds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing
sledge.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13920">31</sup> He makes the
depths churn like a boiling caldron<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13921">32</sup> Behind him he
leaves a glistening wake;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one would think the deep had white hair.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13922">33</sup> Nothing on
earth is his equal—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a creature without fear.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13923">34</sup> He looks down
on all that are haughty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is king over all that are proud.”</p>
