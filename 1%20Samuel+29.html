<h5 class="passage-header">Achish Sends David Back to Ziklag</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7969">1</sup> The
Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped
by the spring in Jezreel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7970">2</sup> As the Philistine rulers marched with
their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were
marching at the rear with Achish. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7971">3</sup> The commanders of the Philistines asked,
“What about these Hebrews?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an
officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for
over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found
no fault in him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7972">4</sup> But the
Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, “Send the man
back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not
go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the
fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by
taking the heads of our own men? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7973">5</sup> Isn’t this the David they sang about in
their dances:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Saul has slain his thousands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David his tens of thousands’?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7974">6</sup> So
Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the LORD lives,
you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve
with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have
found no fault in you, but the rulers don’t approve of you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7975">7</sup> Turn back and go
in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7976">8</sup> “But
what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your
servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and
fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7977">9</sup> Achish
answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an
angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said,
‘He must not go up with us into battle.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7978">10</sup> Now get up early, along with your
master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning
as soon as it is light.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7979">11</sup> So
David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the
land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to
Jezreel.</p>
