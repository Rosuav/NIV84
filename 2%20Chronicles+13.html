<h4>2 Chronicles 13</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Abijah King of Judah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11455">1</sup> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11456">2</sup> and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maacah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11456a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> a daughter<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11456b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of Uriel of Gibeah. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11457">3</sup> Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11458">4</sup> Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11459">5</sup> Don’t you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11460">6</sup> Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11461">7</sup> Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11462">8</sup> “And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11463">9</sup> But didn’t you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11464">10</sup> “As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11465">11</sup> Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11466">12</sup> God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11467">13</sup> Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11468">14</sup> Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11469">15</sup> and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11470">16</sup> The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11471">17</sup> Abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel’s able men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11472">18</sup> The men of Israel were subdued on that occasion, and the men of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11473">19</sup> Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11474">20</sup> Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down and he died. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11475">21</sup> But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11476">22</sup> The other events of Abijah’s reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-11456a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-11456" title="Ir a 2 Chronicles 13:2">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> Most Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac (see also 2 Chron. 11:20 and 1 Kings 15:2); Hebrew <i>Micaiah</i></li>
