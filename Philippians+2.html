<h4>Philippians 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Imitating Christ’s Humility</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29377">1</sup> If you
have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any
comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any
tenderness and compassion, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29378">2</sup> then make my joy complete by being
like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29379">3</sup> Do nothing out
of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider
others better than yourselves. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29380">4</sup> Each of you should look not only to your
own interests, but also to the interests of others.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29381">5</sup> Your
attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29382">6</sup> Who,
being in very nature<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29382a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did not consider equality with God something to
be grasped,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29383">7</sup> but made
himself nothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking the very nature<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29383b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of a servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being made in human likeness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29384">8</sup> And being found
in appearance as a man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he humbled himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and became obedient to death—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even death on a cross!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29385">9</sup> Therefore God
exalted him to the highest place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave him the name that is above every
name,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29386">10</sup> that at the
name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29387">11</sup> and every
tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Shining as Stars</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29388">12</sup>
Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in
my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out
your salvation with fear and trembling, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29389">13</sup> for it is God who works in you to will
and to act according to his good purpose.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29390">14</sup> Do
everything without complaining or arguing, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29391">15</sup> so that you may become blameless and
pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved
generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29392">16</sup> as you hold
out<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29392c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> the word of life—in order that I
may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for
nothing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29393">17</sup> But
even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the
sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice
with all of you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29394">18</sup> So you too should be glad and rejoice
with me.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Timothy and Epaphroditus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29395">19</sup> I hope
in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be
cheered when I receive news about you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29396">20</sup> I have no one else like him, who takes
a genuine interest in your welfare. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29397">21</sup> For everyone looks out for his own
interests, not those of Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29398">22</sup> But you know that Timothy has proved
himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in
the work of the gospel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29399">23</sup> I hope, therefore, to send him as soon
as I see how things go with me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29400">24</sup> And I am confident in the Lord that I
myself will come soon.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29401">25</sup> But I
think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother,
fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom
you sent to take care of my needs. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29402">26</sup> For he longs for all of you and is
distressed because you heard he was ill. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29403">27</sup> Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But
God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare
me sorrow upon sorrow. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29404">28</sup> Therefore I am all the more eager to
send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may
have less anxiety. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29405">29</sup> Welcome him in the Lord with great joy,
and honor men like him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29406">30</sup> because he almost died for the work of
Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give
me.</p>
