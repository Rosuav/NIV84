<h4>2 Peter 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Day of the Lord</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30508">1</sup> Dear
friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both
of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30509">2</sup> I want you to
recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the
command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30510">3</sup> First
of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will
come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30511">4</sup> They will say, “Where is
this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything
goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30512">5</sup> But they deliberately
forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the
earth was formed out of water and by water. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30513">6</sup> By these waters also the world of
that time was deluged and destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30514">7</sup> By the same word the present heavens and
earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and
destruction of ungodly men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30515">8</sup> But do
not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is
like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30516">9</sup> The Lord is not
slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is
patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to
come to repentance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30517">10</sup> But
the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will
disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and
the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30517a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30518">11</sup> Since
everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought
you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30519">12</sup> as you look forward to
the day of God and speed its coming.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30519b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> That
day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and
the elements will melt in the heat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30520">13</sup> But in keeping with his promise we are
looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of
righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30521">14</sup> So
then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make
every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30522">15</sup> Bear in mind
that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother
Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30523">16</sup> He writes the same way in
all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters
contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and
unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their
own destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30524">17</sup>
Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your
guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless
men and fall from your secure position. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30525">18</sup> But grow in the grace and knowledge of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and
forever! Amen.</p>
