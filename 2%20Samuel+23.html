<h4>2 Samuel 23</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Last Words of David</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8655">1</sup> These are the last words of David: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The oracle of David son of Jesse, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of the man exalted by the Most High, <br />the man anointed by the God of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s singer of songs<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8655a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8656">2</sup> “The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his word was on my tongue. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8657">3</sup> The God of Israel spoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Rock of Israel said to me: <br />‘When one rules over men in righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he rules in the fear of God, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8658">4</sup> he is like the light of morning at sunrise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a cloudless morning, <br />like the brightness after rain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that brings the grass from the earth.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8659">5</sup> “Is not my house right with God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he not made with me an everlasting covenant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arranged and secured in every part? <br />Will he not bring to fruition my salvation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grant me my every desire? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8660">6</sup> But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which are not gathered with the hand. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8661">7</sup> Whoever touches thorns <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are burned up where they lie.” <h5 class="passage-header">David’s Mighty Men</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8662">8</sup> These are the names of David’s mighty men: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josheb-Basshebeth,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8662b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> a Tahkemonite,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8662c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8662d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> in one encounter. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8663">9</sup> Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8663e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8664">10</sup> but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8665">11</sup> Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8666">12</sup> But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8667">13</sup> During harvest time, three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8668">14</sup> At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8669">15</sup> David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8670">16</sup> So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8671">17</sup> “Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!” he said. “Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?” And David would not drink it. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the exploits of the three mighty men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8672">18</sup> Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8672f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8673">19</sup> Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8674">20</sup> Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab’s best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8675">21</sup> And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8676">22</sup> Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8677">23</sup> He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8678">24</sup> Among the Thirty were: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asahel the brother of Joab, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8679">25</sup> Shammah the Harodite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika the Harodite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8680">26</sup> Helez the Paltite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8681">27</sup> Abiezer from Anathoth, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mebunnai<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8681g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> the Hushathite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8682">28</sup> Zalmon the Ahohite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maharai the Netophathite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8683">29</sup> Heled<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8683h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> son of Baanah the Netophathite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8684">30</sup> Benaiah the Pirathonite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiddai<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8684i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> from the ravines of Gaash, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8685">31</sup> Abi-Albon the Arbathite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azmaveth the Barhumite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8686">32</sup> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of Jashen, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8687">33</sup> son of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8687j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> Shammah the Hararite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahiam son of Sharar<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8687k" title="Vea nota al pie k">k</a>]</sup> the Hararite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8688">34</sup> Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8689">35</sup> Hezro the Carmelite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paarai the Arbite, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8690">36</sup> Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Hagri,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8690l" title="Vea nota al pie l">l</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8691">37</sup> Zelek the Ammonite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8692">38</sup> Ira the Ithrite, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareb the Ithrite <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8693">39</sup> and Uriah the Hittite. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were thirty-seven in all. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8655a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8655" title="Ir a 2 Samuel 23:1">2 Samuel 23:1</a> Or <i>Israel’s beloved singer</i></li>
