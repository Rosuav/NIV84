<h4>Genesis 4</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Cain and Abel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-81">1</sup> Adam<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-81a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-81b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> She said, “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-81c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> a man.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-82">2</sup> Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-83">3</sup> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-84">4</sup> But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-85">5</sup> but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-86">6</sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-87">7</sup> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-88">8</sup> Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-88d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-89">9</sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-90">10</sup> The LORD said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-91">11</sup> Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-92">12</sup> When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-93">13</sup> Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is more than I can bear. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-94">14</sup> Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-95">15</sup> But the LORD said to him, “Not so<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-95e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-96">16</sup> So Cain went out from the LORD’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-96f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> east of Eden. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-97">17</sup> Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-98">18</sup> To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-99">19</sup> Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-100">20</sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-101">21</sup> His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-102">22</sup> Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-102g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-103">23</sup> Lamech said to his wives, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Adah and Zillah, listen to me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wives of Lamech, hear my words. <br />I have killed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-103h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> a man for wounding me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a young man for injuring me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-104">24</sup> If Cain is avenged seven times, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Lamech seventy-seven times.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-105">25</sup> Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-105i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-106">26</sup> Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time men began to call on<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-106j" title="Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> the name of the LORD. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-81a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-81" title="Ir a Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4:1</a> Or <i>The man</i></li>
