<h4>1 Samuel 8</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Israel Asks for a King</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7371">1</sup> When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7372">2</sup> The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7373">3</sup> But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7374">4</sup> So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7375">5</sup> They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7375a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> us, such as all the other nations have.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7376">6</sup> But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7377">7</sup> And the LORD told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7378">8</sup> As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7379">9</sup> Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7380">10</sup> Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7381">11</sup> He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will do: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7382">12</sup> Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7383">13</sup> He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7384">14</sup> He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7385">15</sup> He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7386">16</sup> Your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7386b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and donkeys he will take for his own use. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7387">17</sup> He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7388">18</sup> When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, and the LORD will not answer you in that day.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7389">19</sup> But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7390">20</sup> Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7391">21</sup> When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7392">22</sup> The LORD answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go back to his town.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-7375a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-7375" title="Ir a 1 Samuel 8:5">1 Samuel 8:5</a> Traditionally <i>judge</i>; also in verses 6 and 20</li>
