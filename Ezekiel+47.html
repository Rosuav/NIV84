<h4>Ezekiel 47</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The River From the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21681">1</sup> The man
brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water
coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east
(for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under
the south side of the temple, south of the altar. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21682">2</sup> He then brought me out
through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer
gate facing east, and the water was flowing from the south side.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21683">3</sup> As the
man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured
off a thousand cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21683a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and then
led me through water that was ankle-deep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21684">4</sup> He measured off another thousand cubits
and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off
another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21685">5</sup> He measured off
another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross,
because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river
that no one could cross. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21686">6</sup> He asked me, “Son of man, do you see
this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21687">7</sup> When I arrived
there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21688">8</sup> He said to me,
“This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the
Arabah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21688b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> where it enters the Sea.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21688c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> When it empties into the
Sea,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21688d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the water there becomes fresh.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21689">9</sup> Swarms of
living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be
large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the
salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21690">10</sup> Fishermen will
stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be
places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the
fish of the Great Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21690e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21691">11</sup> But the swamps
and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21692">12</sup> Fruit trees of
all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will
not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear,
because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit
will serve for food and their leaves for healing.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Boundaries of the Land</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21693">13</sup> This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: “These are the boundaries by which
you are to divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve
tribes of Israel, with two portions for Joseph. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21694">14</sup> You are to divide it
equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it
to your forefathers, this land will become your inheritance.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21695">15</sup> “This
is to be the boundary of the land:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On the north side it will run from the Great
Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21695f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> Hamath to
Zedad, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21696">16</sup>
Berothah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21696g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> and Sibraim (which lies on the border
between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hatticon, which is on
the border of Hauran. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21697">17</sup> The boundary will extend from the sea
to Hazar Enan,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21697h"
title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> along the northern border of
Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the
north boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21698">18</sup> “On
the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus,
along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the
eastern sea and as far as Tamar.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21698i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> This will
be the east boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21699">19</sup> “On
the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of
Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea. This
will be the south boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21700">20</sup> “On
the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point
opposite Lebo<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21700j"
title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> Hamath. This will be the west
boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21701">21</sup> “You
are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the
tribes of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21702">22</sup> You are to allot it as an inheritance
for yourselves and for the aliens who have settled among you and
who have children. You are to consider them as native-born
Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance
among the tribes of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21703">23</sup> In whatever tribe the alien settles,
there you are to give him his inheritance,” declares the Sovereign
LORD.</p>
