<h4>1 Samuel 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Samuel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7214">1</sup> There was
a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7214a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> from the hill country of Ephraim,
whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of
Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7215">2</sup> He had two wives; one was called Hannah
and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7216">3</sup> Year
after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice
to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two
sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7217">4</sup> Whenever the day came for Elkanah to
sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah
and to all her sons and daughters. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7218">5</sup> But to Hannah he gave a double portion
because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7219">6</sup> And because the LORD had
closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate
her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7220">7</sup> This went
on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the
LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7221">8</sup> Elkanah her
husband would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t
you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten
sons?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7222">9</sup> Once
when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood
up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of
the LORD’s temple.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7222b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7223">10</sup> In bitterness
of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7224">11</sup> And she made a vow,
saying, “O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant’s
misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a
son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life,
and no razor will ever be used on his head.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7225">12</sup> As she
kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7226">13</sup> Hannah was praying in her
heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli
thought she was drunk <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7227">14</sup> and said to her, “How long will you keep
on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7228">15</sup> “Not
so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled.
I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7229">16</sup> Do
not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here
out of my great anguish and grief.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7230">17</sup> Eli
answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what
you have asked of him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7231">18</sup> She
said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her
way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7232">19</sup> Early
the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then
went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife,
and the LORD remembered her. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7233">20</sup> So in the course of time Hannah
conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7233c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> saying, “Because I asked the LORD
for him.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Hannah Dedicates Samuel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7234">21</sup> When the
man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual
sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7235">22</sup> Hannah did not go. She said to her
husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him
before the LORD, and he will live there always.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7236">23</sup> “Do
what seems best to you,” Elkanah her husband told her. “Stay here
until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good
his<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7236d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> word.” So the woman stayed at home
and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7237">24</sup> After
he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along
with a three-year-old bull,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7237e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> an
ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7237f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of flour and a skin of wine, and
brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7238">25</sup> When they had slaughtered
the bull, they brought the boy to Eli, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7239">26</sup> and she said to him, “As surely as you
live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7240">27</sup> I
prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7241">28</sup> So now I
give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to
the LORD.” And he worshiped the LORD there.</p>
