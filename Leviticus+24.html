<h4>Leviticus 24</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Oil and Bread Set Before the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3448">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3449">2</sup>
“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives
for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3450">3</sup> Outside the
curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend
the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually.
This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3451">4</sup> The lamps on the
pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3452">5</sup> “Take
fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an
ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3452a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> for each loaf. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3453">6</sup> Set them in two rows, six
in each row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3454">7</sup> Along each row put some
pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be
an offering made to the LORD by fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3455">8</sup> This bread is to be set out before the
LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites,
as a lasting covenant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3456">9</sup> It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are
to eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy part of their
regular share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Blasphemer Stoned</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3457">10</sup> Now the
son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among
the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and
an Israelite. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3458">11</sup>
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so
they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the
daughter of Dibri the Danite.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3459">12</sup> They put him in custody until the will
of the LORD should be made clear to them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3460">13</sup> Then
the LORD said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3461">14</sup> “Take the blasphemer outside the camp.
All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the
entire assembly is to stone him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3462">15</sup> Say to the Israelites: ‘If anyone curses
his God, he will be held responsible; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3463">16</sup> anyone who blasphemes the name of the
LORD must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him.
Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he
must be put to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3464">17</sup> “‘If
anyone takes the life of a human being, he must be put to death.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3465">18</sup> Anyone who
takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life for
life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3466">19</sup> If anyone
injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3467">20</sup> fracture for
fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the
other, so he is to be injured. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3468">21</sup> Whoever kills an animal must make
restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3469">22</sup> You are to have
the same law for the alien and the native-born. I am the LORD your
God.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3470">23</sup> Then
Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside
the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
