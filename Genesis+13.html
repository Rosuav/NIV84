<h4>Genesis 13</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Abram and Lot Separate</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-320">1</sup> So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-321">2</sup> Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-322">3</sup> From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-323">4</sup> and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-324">5</sup> Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-325">6</sup> But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-326">7</sup> And quarreling arose between Abram’s herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-327">8</sup> So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-328">9</sup> Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-329">10</sup> Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-330">11</sup> So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-331">12</sup> Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-332">13</sup> Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-333">14</sup> The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-334">15</sup> All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-334a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> forever. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-335">16</sup> I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-336">17</sup> Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-337">18</sup> So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-334a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-334" title="Ir a Genesis 13:15">Genesis 13:15</a> Or <i>seed</i>; also in verse 16</li>
