<h4>Jeremiah 36</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoiakim Burns Jeremiah’s Scroll</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19844">1</sup> In the
fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word
came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19845">2</sup> “Take a scroll and write on it all the
words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the
other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of
Josiah till now. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19846">3</sup> Perhaps when the people of Judah hear
about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will
turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and
their sin.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19847">4</sup> So
Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated
all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the
scroll. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19848">5</sup> Then
Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I cannot go to the LORD’s
temple. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19849">6</sup> So you
go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the
people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I
dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from
their towns. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19850">7</sup>
Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each
will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced
against this people by the LORD are great.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19851">8</sup> Baruch
son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do;
at the LORD’s temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19852">9</sup> In the ninth
month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a
time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people
in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19853">10</sup> From the room
of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper
courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch
read to all the people at the LORD’s temple the words of Jeremiah
from the scroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19854">11</sup> When
Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of
the LORD from the scroll, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19855">12</sup> he went down to the secretary’s room in
the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama
the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor,
Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the
other officials. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19856">13</sup> After Micaiah told them everything he
had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19857">14</sup> all the officials sent
Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to
say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the
people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the
scroll in his hand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19858">15</sup> They said to him, “Sit down, please,
and read it to us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Baruch read it to them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19859">16</sup> When they heard all these
words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We
must report all these words to the king.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19860">17</sup> Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how
did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19861">18</sup>
“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I
wrote them in ink on the scroll.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19862">19</sup> Then
the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t
let anyone know where you are.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19863">20</sup> After
they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they
went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19864">21</sup> The king sent
Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of
Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the
officials standing beside him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19865">22</sup> It was the ninth month and the king was
sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot
in front of him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19866">23</sup> Whenever Jehudi had read three or four
columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife
and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned
in the fire. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19867">24</sup>
The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no
fear, nor did they tear their clothes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19868">25</sup> Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and
Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen
to them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19869">26</sup>
Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah
son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the
scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19870">27</sup> After
the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had
written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19871">28</sup>
“Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the
first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19872">29</sup> Also tell Jehoiakim king
of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and
said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would
certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and
animals from it?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19873">30</sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says
about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the
throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the
heat by day and the frost by night. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19874">31</sup> I will punish him and his children and
his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those
living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I
pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19875">32</sup> So
Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son
of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the
words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the
fire. And many similar words were added to them.</p>
