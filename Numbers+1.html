They were the heads of the clans of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3622">17</sup> Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3623">18</sup> and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3624">19</sup> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3625">20</sup> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the
