<h4>2 Kings 24</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10204">1</sup> During
Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land,
and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he
changed his mind and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10205">2</sup> The LORD sent
Babylonian,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10205a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Aramean, Moabite and
Ammonite raiders against him. He sent them to destroy Judah, in
accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by his servants the
prophets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10206">3</sup>
Surely these things happened to Judah according to the LORD’s
command, in order to remove them from his presence because of the
sins of Manasseh and all he had done, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10207">4</sup> including the shedding of innocent
blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the
LORD was not willing to forgive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10208">5</sup> As for
the other events of Jehoiakim’s reign, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10209">6</sup> Jehoiakim
rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as
king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10210">7</sup> The
king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, because
the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Wadi of
Egypt to the Euphrates River.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoiachin King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10211">8</sup>
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta
daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10212">9</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD,
just as his father had done.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10213">10</sup> At
that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced
on Jerusalem and laid siege to it, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10214">11</sup> and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to
the city while his officers were besieging it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10215">12</sup> Jehoiachin king of Judah,
his mother, his attendants, his nobles and his officials all
surrendered to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eighth year of the reign of the king of
Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10216">13</sup> As the LORD had declared,
Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the
LORD and from the royal palace, and took away all the gold articles
that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10217">14</sup> He carried
into exile all Jerusalem: all the officers and fighting men, and
all the craftsmen and artisans—a total of ten thousand. Only the
poorest people of the land were left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10218">15</sup>
Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took
from Jerusalem to Babylon the king’s mother, his wives, his
officials and the leading men of the land. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10219">16</sup> The king of Babylon also deported to
Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and
fit for war, and a thousand craftsmen and artisans. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10220">17</sup> He made Mattaniah,
Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to
Zedekiah.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zedekiah King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10221">18</sup> Zedekiah
was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10222">19</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD,
just as Jehoiakim had done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10223">20</sup> It was because of the LORD’s anger that
all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust
them from his presence.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Fall of Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of
Babylon.
