<h4>Daniel 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Daniel in the Den of Lions</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21907">1</sup> It
pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the
kingdom, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21908">2</sup> with
three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps
were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer
loss. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21909">3</sup> Now
Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the
satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set
him over the whole kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21910">4</sup> At this, the administrators and the
satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his
conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They
could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and
neither corrupt nor negligent. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21911">5</sup> Finally these men said, “We will never
find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has
something to do with the law of his God.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21912">6</sup> So the
administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and
said: “O King Darius, live forever! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21913">7</sup> The royal administrators, prefects,
satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king
should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays
to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O
king, shall be thrown into the lions’ den. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21914">8</sup> Now, O king, issue the decree and put
it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the
laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21915">9</sup> So King Darius
put the decree in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21916">10</sup> Now
when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went
home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward
Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed,
giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21917">11</sup> Then these men went as a
group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21918">12</sup> So they went to the king
and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a
decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god
or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions’
den?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king answered, “The decree stands—in
accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be
repealed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21919">13</sup> Then
they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from
Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put
in writing. He still prays three times a day.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21920">14</sup> When the king heard this,
he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and
made every effort until sundown to save him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21921">15</sup> Then
the men went as a group to the king and said to him, “Remember, O
king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree
or edict that the king issues can be changed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21922">16</sup> So
the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into
the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you
serve continually, rescue you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21923">17</sup> A
stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the
king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his
nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21924">18</sup> Then the king
returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and
without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not
sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21925">19</sup> At
the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’
den. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21926">20</sup> When he
came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice,
“Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve
continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21927">21</sup>
Daniel answered, “O king, live forever! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21928">22</sup> My God sent his angel, and he shut the
mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found
innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O
king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21929">23</sup> The
king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den.
And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him,
because he had trusted in his God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21930">24</sup> At
the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were
brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives
and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the
lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21931">25</sup> Then
King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every
language throughout the land:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“May you prosper greatly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21932">26</sup> “I
issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear
and reverence the God of Daniel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For he is the living God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he endures forever;<br>
his kingdom will not be destroyed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his dominion will never end.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21933">27</sup> He rescues and
he saves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he performs signs and wonders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the heavens and on the earth.<br>
He has rescued Daniel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the power of the lions.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21934">28</sup> So
Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of
Cyrus<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21934a" title=
