<h5 class="passage-header">Regulations About Infectious Skin
Diseases</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3054">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses and Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3055">2</sup> “When anyone has a swelling or a rash or
a bright spot on his skin that may become an infectious skin
disease,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3055a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> he must be brought to Aaron the
priest or to one of his sons<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3055b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> who is
a priest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3056">3</sup> The
priest is to examine the sore on his skin, and if the hair in the
sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin
deep,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3056c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> it is an infectious skin disease.
When the priest examines him, he shall pronounce him ceremonially
unclean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3057">4</sup> If the
spot on his skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin
deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to put
the infected person in isolation for seven days. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3058">5</sup> On the seventh day the
priest is to examine him, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged
and has not spread in the skin, he is to keep him in isolation
another seven days. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3059">6</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to
examine him again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in
the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a rash.
The man must wash his clothes, and he will be clean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3060">7</sup> But if the rash does spread
in his skin after he has shown himself to the priest to be
pronounced clean, he must appear before the priest again.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3061">8</sup> The priest is to
examine him, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall
pronounce him unclean; it is an infectious disease.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3062">9</sup> “When
anyone has an infectious skin disease, he must be brought to the
priest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3063">10</sup> The
priest is to examine him, and if there is a white swelling in the
skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in
the swelling, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3064">11</sup>
it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce him
unclean. He is not to put him in isolation, because he is already
unclean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3065">12</sup> “If
the disease breaks out all over his skin and, so far as the priest
can see, it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to
foot, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3066">13</sup> the
priest is to examine him, and if the disease has covered his whole
body, he shall pronounce that person clean. Since it has all turned
white, he is clean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3067">14</sup> But whenever raw flesh appears on him,
he will be unclean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3068">15</sup> When the priest sees the raw flesh, he
shall pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; he has an
infectious disease. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3069">16</sup> Should the raw flesh change and turn
white, he must go to the priest. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3070">17</sup> The priest is to examine him, and if the
sores have turned white, the priest shall pronounce the infected
person clean; then he will be clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3071">18</sup> “When
someone has a boil on his skin and it heals, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3072">19</sup> and in the place where the boil was,
a white swelling or reddish-white spot appears, he must present
himself to the priest. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3073">20</sup> The priest is to examine it, and if it
appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has turned
white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious
skin disease that has broken out where the boil was. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3074">21</sup> But if, when the priest
examines it, there is no white hair in it and it is not more than
skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to put him in isolation
for seven days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3075">22</sup>
If it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him
unclean; it is infectious. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3076">23</sup> But if the spot is unchanged and has not
spread, it is only a scar from the boil, and the priest shall
pronounce him clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3077">24</sup> “When
someone has a burn on his skin and a reddish-white or white spot
appears in the raw flesh of the burn, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3078">25</sup> the priest is to examine the spot, and
if the hair in it has turned white, and it appears to be more than
skin deep, it is an infectious disease that has broken out in the
burn. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infectious
skin disease. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3079">26</sup>
But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the
spot and if it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the
priest is to put him in isolation for seven days. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3080">27</sup> On the seventh day the
priest is to examine him, and if it is spreading in the skin, the
priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infectious skin
disease. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3081">28</sup> If,
however, the spot is unchanged and has not spread in the skin but
has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall
pronounce him clean; it is only a scar from the burn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3082">29</sup> “If a
man or woman has a sore on the head or on the chin, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3083">30</sup> the priest is to examine
the sore, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair
in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce that person
unclean; it is an itch, an infectious disease of the head or chin.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3084">31</sup> But if, when
the priest examines this kind of sore, it does not seem to be more
than skin deep and there is no black hair in it, then the priest is
to put the infected person in isolation for seven days. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3085">32</sup> On the seventh day the
priest is to examine the sore, and if the itch has not spread and
there is no yellow hair in it and it does not appear to be more
than skin deep, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3086">33</sup>
he must be shaved except for the diseased area, and the priest is
to keep him in isolation another seven days. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3087">34</sup> On the seventh day the priest is to
examine the itch, and if it has not spread in the skin and appears
to be no more than skin deep, the priest shall pronounce him clean.
He must wash his clothes, and he will be clean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3088">35</sup> But if the itch does
spread in the skin after he is pronounced clean, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3089">36</sup> the priest is to examine
him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest does not
need to look for yellow hair; the person is unclean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3090">37</sup> If, however, in his
judgment it is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch
is healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him
clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3091">38</sup> “When
a man or woman has white spots on the skin, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3092">39</sup> the priest is to examine them, and if
the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out
on the skin; that person is clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3093">40</sup> “When
a man has lost his hair and is bald, he is clean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3094">41</sup> If he has lost his hair
from the front of his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is clean.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3095">42</sup> But if he has a
reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is an
infectious disease breaking out on his head or forehead.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3096">43</sup> The priest is
to examine him, and if the swollen sore on his head or forehead is
reddish-white like an infectious skin disease, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3097">44</sup> the man is diseased and is
unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean because of the sore
on his head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3098">45</sup> “The
person with such an infectious disease must wear torn clothes, let
his hair be unkempt,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3098d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> cover
the lower part of his face and cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3099">46</sup> As long as he
has the infection he remains unclean. He must live alone; he must
live outside the camp.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Regulations About Mildew</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3100">47</sup> “If any
clothing is contaminated with mildew—any woolen or linen clothing,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3101">48</sup> any woven or
knitted material of linen or wool, any leather or anything made of
leather— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3102">49</sup> and if
the contamination in the clothing, or leather, or woven or knitted
material, or any leather article, is greenish or reddish, it is a
spreading mildew and must be shown to the priest. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3103">50</sup> The priest is to examine
the mildew and isolate the affected article for seven days.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3104">51</sup> On the seventh
day he is to examine it, and if the mildew has spread in the
clothing, or the woven or knitted material, or the leather,
whatever its use, it is a destructive mildew; the article is
unclean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3105">52</sup> He
must burn up the clothing, or the woven or knitted material of wool
or linen, or any leather article that has the contamination in it,
because the mildew is destructive; the article must be burned up.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3106">53</sup> “But
if, when the priest examines it, the mildew has not spread in the
clothing, or the woven or knitted material, or the leather article,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3107">54</sup> he shall order
that the contaminated article be washed. Then he is to isolate it
for another seven days. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3108">55</sup> After the affected article has been
washed, the priest is to examine it, and if the mildew has not
changed its appearance, even though it has not spread, it is
unclean. Burn it with fire, whether the mildew has affected one
side or the other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3109">56</sup> If, when the priest examines it, the
mildew has faded after the article has been washed, he is to tear
the contaminated part out of the clothing, or the leather, or the
woven or knitted material. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3110">57</sup> But if it reappears in the clothing, or
in the woven or knitted material, or in the leather article, it is
spreading, and whatever has the mildew must be burned with fire.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3111">58</sup> The clothing,
or the woven or knitted material, or any leather article that has
been washed and is rid of the mildew, must be washed again, and it
will be clean.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3112">59</sup> These
are the regulations concerning contamination by mildew in woolen or
linen clothing, woven or knitted material, or any leather article,
for pronouncing them clean or unclean.</p>
