<h4>1 Samuel 22</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David at Adullam and Mizpah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7789">1</sup> David left
Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his
father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7790">2</sup> All those who
were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him,
and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7791">3</sup> From
there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab,
“Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I
learn what God will do for me?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7792">4</sup> So he left them with the king of Moab,
and they stayed with him as long as David was in the
stronghold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7793">5</sup> But the
prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into
the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of
Hereth.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul Kills the Priests of Nob</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7794">6</sup> Now Saul
heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear
in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah,
with all his officials standing around him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7795">7</sup> Saul said to them, “Listen, men of
Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and
vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and
commanders of hundreds? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7796">8</sup> Is that why you have all conspired
against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the
son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my
son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does
today.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7797">9</sup> But
Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I
saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7798">10</sup> Ahimelech
inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the
sword of Goliath the Philistine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7799">11</sup> Then
the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his
father’s whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all
came to the king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7800">12</sup> Saul said, “Listen now, son of
Ahitub.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, my lord,” he answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7801">13</sup> Saul
said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of
Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him,
so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he
does today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7802">14</sup>
Ahimelech answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal
as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and
highly respected in your household? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7803">15</sup> Was that day the first time I inquired
of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant
or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at
all about this whole affair.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7804">16</sup> But
the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your
father’s whole family.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7805">17</sup> Then
the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests
of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he
was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king’s officials were not willing to
raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7806">18</sup> The
king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So
Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed
eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7807">19</sup> He also put to the sword Nob, the town
of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants,
and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7808">20</sup> But
Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to
join David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7809">21</sup> He
told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7810">22</sup> Then David said
to Abiathar: “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he
would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your
father’s whole family. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7811">23</sup> Stay with me; don’t be afraid; the man
who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe
with me.”</p>
