<p><h4>Luke 22</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25857">1</sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25858">2</sup> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25859">3</sup> Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25860">4</sup> And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25861">5</sup> They were delighted and agreed to give him money. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25862">6</sup> He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. <h5 class="passage-header">The Last Supper</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25863">7</sup> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25864">8</sup> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <font class='woj'>“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25865">9</sup> “Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25866">10</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25867">11</sup> and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25868">12</sup> He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25869">13</sup> They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25870">14</sup> When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25871">15</sup> And he said to them, <font class='woj'>“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25872">16</sup> For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25873">17</sup> After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, <font class='woj'>“Take this and divide it among you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25874">18</sup> For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25875">19</sup> And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <font class='woj'>“This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25876">20</sup> In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, <font class='woj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25877">21</sup> But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25878">22</sup> The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25879">23</sup> They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25880">24</sup> Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25881">25</sup> Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25882">26</sup> But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25883">27</sup> For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25884">28</sup> You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25885">29</sup> And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25886">30</sup> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25887">31</sup> “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25887a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> as wheat.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25888">32</sup> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25889">33</sup> But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25890">34</sup> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25891">35</sup> Then Jesus asked them, <font class='woj'>“When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing,” they answered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25892">36</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25893">37</sup> It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25893b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25894">38</sup> The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“That is enough,”</font> he replied. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25895">39</sup> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25896">40</sup> On reaching the place, he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25897">41</sup> He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25898">42</sup> “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25899">43</sup> An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25900">44</sup> And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25900c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25901">45</sup> When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25902">46</sup> “Why are you sleeping?”</font> he asked them. <font class='woj'>“Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Arrested</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25903">47</sup> While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25904">48</sup> but Jesus asked him, <font class='woj'>“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25905">49</sup> When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25906">50</sup> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25907">51</sup> But Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“No more of this!”</font> And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25908">52</sup> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, <font class='woj'>“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25909">53</sup> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Peter Disowns Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25910">54</sup> Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25911">55</sup> But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25912">56</sup> A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25913">57</sup> But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25914">58</sup> A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, I am not!” Peter replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25915">59</sup> About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25916">60</sup> Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25917">61</sup> The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: <font class='woj'>“Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25918">62</sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly. <h5 class="passage-header">The Guards Mock Jesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25919">63</sup> The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25920">64</sup> They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25921">65</sup> And they said many other insulting things to him. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Before Pilate and Herod</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25922">66</sup> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25923">67</sup> “If you are the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25923d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>” they said, “tell us.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“If I tell you, you will not believe me,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25924">68</sup> and if I asked you, you would not answer.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25925">69</sup> But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25926">70</sup> They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, <font class='woj'>“You are right in saying I am.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25927">71</sup> Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25887a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25887" title="Ir a Luke 22:31">Luke 22:31</a> The Greek is plural.</li>
