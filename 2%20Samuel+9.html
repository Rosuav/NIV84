<h4>2 Samuel 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">David and Mephibosheth</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8229">1</sup> David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8230">2</sup> Now there was a servant of Saul’s household named Ziba. They called him to appear before David, and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your servant,” he replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8231">3</sup> The king asked, “Is there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show God’s kindness?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba answered the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8232">4</sup> “Where is he?” the king asked. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba answered, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8233">5</sup> So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8234">6</sup> When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David said, “Mephibosheth!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your servant,” he replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8235">7</sup> “Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8236">8</sup> Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8237">9</sup> Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8238">10</sup> You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master’s grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8239">11</sup> Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8239a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> table like one of the king’s sons. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8240">12</sup> Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all the members of Ziba’s household were servants of Mephibosheth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8241">13</sup> And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table, and he was crippled in both feet. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-8239a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-8239" title="Ir a 2 Samuel 9:11">2 Samuel 9:11</a> Septuagint; Hebrew <i>my</i></li>
