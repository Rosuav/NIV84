<h4>Ephesians 4</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Unity in the Body of Christ</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29258">1</sup> As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29259">2</sup> Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29260">3</sup> Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29261">4</sup> There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29262">5</sup> one Lord, one faith, one baptism; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29263">6</sup> one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29264">7</sup> But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29265">8</sup> This is why it<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29265a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When he ascended on high, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he led captives in his train <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave gifts to men.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29265b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29266">9</sup> (What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29266c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29267">10</sup> He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29268">11</sup> It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29269">12</sup> to prepare God’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29270">13</sup> until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29271">14</sup> Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29272">15</sup> Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29273">16</sup> From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. <h5 class="passage-header">Living as Children of Light</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29274">17</sup> So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29275">18</sup> They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29276">19</sup> Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29277">20</sup> You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29278">21</sup> Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29279">22</sup> You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29280">23</sup> to be made new in the attitude of your minds; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29281">24</sup> and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29282">25</sup> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29283">26</sup> “In your anger do not sin”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29283d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29284">27</sup> and do not give the devil a foothold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29285">28</sup> He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29286">29</sup> Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29287">30</sup> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29288">31</sup> Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29289">32</sup> Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29265a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29265" title="Ir a Ephesians 4:8">Ephesians 4:8</a> Or <i>God</i></li>
