<h5 class="passage-header">David’s House and Family</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10776">1</sup> Now Hiram
king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs,
stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10777">2</sup> And David knew that the
LORD had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom
had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10778">3</sup> In
Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons
and daughters. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10779">4</sup>
These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua,
Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10780">5</sup> Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10781">6</sup> Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10782">7</sup> Elishama,
Beeliada<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10782a" title=

<h5 class="passage-header">David Defeats the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10783">8</sup> When the
Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all
Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David
heard about it and went out to meet them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10784">9</sup> Now the Philistines had come and raided
the Valley of Rephaim; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10785">10</sup> so David inquired of God: “Shall I go
and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD answered him, “Go, I will hand them
over to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10786">11</sup> So
David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated
them. He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my
enemies by my hand.” So that place was called Baal
Perazim.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10786b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10787">12</sup> The Philistines had abandoned their
gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10788">13</sup> Once
more the Philistines raided the valley; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10789">14</sup> so David inquired of God again, and God
answered him, “Do not go straight up, but circle around them and
attack them in front of the balsam trees. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10790">15</sup> As soon as you hear the sound of
marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle,
because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike
the Philistine army.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10791">16</sup> So David did as God commanded him, and
they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to
Gezer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10792">17</sup> So
David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the LORD made all
the nations fear him.</p>
