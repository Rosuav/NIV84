<p><h4>Lamentations 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20312">1</sup> <sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20312a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>How deserted lies the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once so full of people! <br />How like a widow is she, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who once was great among the nations! <br />She who was queen among the provinces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has now become a slave. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20313">2</sup> Bitterly she weeps at night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tears are upon her cheeks. <br />Among all her lovers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none to comfort her. <br />All her friends have betrayed her; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have become her enemies. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20314">3</sup> After affliction and harsh labor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah has gone into exile. <br />She dwells among the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she finds no resting place. <br />All who pursue her have overtaken her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of her distress. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20315">4</sup> The roads to Zion mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for no one comes to her appointed feasts. <br />All her gateways are desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her priests groan, <br />her maidens grieve, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she is in bitter anguish. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20316">5</sup> Her foes have become her masters; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her enemies are at ease. <br />The LORD has brought her grief <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of her many sins. <br />Her children have gone into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captive before the foe. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20317">6</sup> All the splendor has departed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Daughter of Zion. <br />Her princes are like deer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that find no pasture; <br />in weakness they have fled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the pursuer. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20318">7</sup> In the days of her affliction and wandering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem remembers all the treasures <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were hers in days of old. <br />When her people fell into enemy hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was no one to help her. <br />Her enemies looked at her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laughed at her destruction. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20319">8</sup> Jerusalem has sinned greatly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so has become unclean. <br />All who honored her despise her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have seen her nakedness; <br />she herself groans <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turns away. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20320">9</sup> Her filthiness clung to her skirts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she did not consider her future. <br />Her fall was astounding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was none to comfort her. <br />“Look, O LORD, on my affliction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the enemy has triumphed.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20321">10</sup> The enemy laid hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all her treasures; <br />she saw pagan nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter her sanctuary— <br />those you had forbidden <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enter your assembly. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20322">11</sup> All her people groan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they search for bread; <br />they barter their treasures for food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep themselves alive. <br />“Look, O LORD, and consider, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am despised.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20323">12</sup> “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look around and see. <br />Is any suffering like my suffering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was inflicted on me, <br />that the LORD brought on me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of his fierce anger? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20324">13</sup> “From on high he sent fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent it down into my bones. <br />He spread a net for my feet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turned me back. <br />He made me desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faint all the day long. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20325">14</sup> “My sins have been bound into a yoke<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20325b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by his hands they were woven together. <br />They have come upon my neck <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Lord has sapped my strength. <br />He has handed me over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those I cannot withstand. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20326">15</sup> “The Lord has rejected <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the warriors in my midst; <br />he has summoned an army against me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20326c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> crush my young men. <br />In his winepress the Lord has trampled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Virgin Daughter of Judah. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20327">16</sup> “This is why I weep <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my eyes overflow with tears. <br />No one is near to comfort me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one to restore my spirit. <br />My children are destitute <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the enemy has prevailed.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20328">17</sup> Zion stretches out her hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no one to comfort her. <br />The LORD has decreed for Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that his neighbors become his foes; <br />Jerusalem has become <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unclean thing among them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20329">18</sup> “The LORD is righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet I rebelled against his command. <br />Listen, all you peoples; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look upon my suffering. <br />My young men and maidens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have gone into exile. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20330">19</sup> “I called to my allies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they betrayed me. <br />My priests and my elders <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perished in the city <br />while they searched for food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep themselves alive. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20331">20</sup> “See, O LORD, how distressed I am! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in torment within, <br />and in my heart I am disturbed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have been most rebellious. <br />Outside, the sword bereaves; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside, there is only death. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20332">21</sup> “People have heard my groaning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no one to comfort me. <br />All my enemies have heard of my distress; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they rejoice at what you have done. <br />May you bring the day you have announced <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they may become like me. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20333">22</sup> “Let all their wickedness come before you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deal with them <br />as you have dealt with me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all my sins. <br />My groans are many <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my heart is faint.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20312a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20312" title="Go to Lamentations 1:1">Lamentations 1:1</a> This chapter is an acrostic poem, the verses of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</li>
