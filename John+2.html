<h4>John 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Changes Water to Wine</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26087">1</sup> On the
third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother
was there, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26088">2</sup> and
Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26089">3</sup> When the wine
was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26090">4</sup> “Dear woman, why do you involve
me?”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“My time has not yet
come.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26091">5</sup> His
mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26092">6</sup> Nearby
stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for
ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty
gallons.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26092a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26093">7</sup> Jesus
said to the servants, <font class='woj'>“Fill the jars with
water”</font>; so they filled them to the brim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26094">8</sup> Then
he told them, <font class='woj'>“Now draw some out and take it to
the master of the banquet.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did so, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26095">9</sup> and the master of the banquet tasted the
water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it
had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew.
Then he called the bridegroom aside <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26096">10</sup> and said, “Everyone brings out the
choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have
had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26097">11</sup> This,
the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in
Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their
faith in him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Clears the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26098">12</sup> After
this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his
disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26099">13</sup> When
it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26100">14</sup> In
the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and
others sitting at tables exchanging money. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26101">15</sup> So he made a whip out of cords, and
drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered
the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26102">16</sup> To those who
sold doves he said, <font class='woj'>“Get these out of here! How
dare you turn my Father’s house into a market!”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26103">17</sup> His
disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will
consume me.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26103b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26104">18</sup> Then
the Jews demanded of him, “What miraculous sign can you show us to
prove your authority to do all this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26105">19</sup> Jesus
answered them, <font class='woj'>“Destroy this temple, and I will
raise it again in three days.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26106">20</sup> The
Jews replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple,
and you are going to raise it in three days?” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26107">21</sup> But the temple he had spoken of was
his body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26108">22</sup>
After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he
had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus
had spoken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26109">23</sup> Now
while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw
the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his
name.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26109c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26110">24</sup> But Jesus would not entrust himself to
them, for he knew all men. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26111">25</sup> He did not need man’s testimony about
man, for he knew what was in a man.</p>
