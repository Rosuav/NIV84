<h5 class="passage-header">The Exile Symbolized</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20682">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20683">2</sup> “Son of man, you are living among a
rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to
hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20684">3</sup>
“Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the
daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to
another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a
rebellious house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20685">4</sup> During the daytime, while they watch,
bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening,
while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20686">5</sup> While they
watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through
it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20687">6</sup> Put them on
your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk.
Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made
you a sign to the house of Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20688">7</sup> So I
did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things
packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with
my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my
shoulders while they watched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20689">8</sup> In the
morning the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20690">9</sup> “Son of man, did not that rebellious
house of Israel ask you, ‘What are you doing?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20691">10</sup> “Say
to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This oracle
concerns the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel who
are there.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20692">11</sup>
Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As I have done, so it will be done to them.
They will go into exile as captives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20693">12</sup> “The
prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and
leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He
will cover his face so that he cannot see the land. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20694">13</sup> I will spread my net for
him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to
Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and
there he will die. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20695">14</sup> I will scatter to the winds all those
around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with
drawn sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20696">15</sup> “They
will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the
nations and scatter them through the countries. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20697">16</sup> But I will spare a few of
them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations
where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices.
Then they will know that I am the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20698">17</sup> The
word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20699">18</sup> “Son of man, tremble as you eat your
food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20700">19</sup> Say to the people of the
land: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says about those living in
Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in
anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be
stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who
live there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20701">20</sup>
The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be
desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20702">21</sup> The
word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20703">22</sup> “Son of man, what is this proverb you
have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes
to nothing’? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20704">23</sup>
Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to
put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in
Israel.’ Say to them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be
fulfilled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20705">24</sup> For
there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among
the people of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20706">25</sup> But I the LORD will speak what I will,
and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you
rebellious house, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the
Sovereign LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20707">26</sup> The
word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20708">27</sup> “Son of man, the house of Israel is
saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he
prophesies about the distant future.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20709">28</sup>
“Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None
of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be
fulfilled, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”</p>
