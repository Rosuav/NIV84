<h4>1 Chronicles 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Becomes King Over Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10675">1</sup> All
Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own
flesh and blood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10676">2</sup> In the past, even while Saul was king,
you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And
the LORD your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel,
and you will become their ruler.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10677">3</sup> When
all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made
a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed
David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through
Samuel.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Conquers Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10678">4</sup> David and
all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The
Jebusites who lived there <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10679">5</sup> said to David, “You will not get in
here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City
of David.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10680">6</sup> David
had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become
commander-in-chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he
received the command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10681">7</sup> David
then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the
City of David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10682">8</sup>
He built up the city around it, from the supporting
terraces<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10682a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to the surrounding wall, while
Joab restored the rest of the city. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10683">9</sup> And David became more and more powerful,
because the LORD Almighty was with him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David’s Mighty Men</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10684">10</sup> These
were the chiefs of David’s mighty men—they, together with all
Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the
whole land, as the LORD had promised— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10685">11</sup> this is the list of David’s mighty men:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jashobeam,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10685b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> a
Hacmonite, was chief of the officers<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10685c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>; he
raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one
encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10686">12</sup> Next
to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three
mighty men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10687">13</sup> He
was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there
for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the
troops fled from the Philistines. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10688">14</sup> But they took their stand in the middle
of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and
the LORD brought about a great victory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10689">15</sup> Three
of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of
Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of
Rephaim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10690">16</sup> At
that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison
was at Bethlehem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10691">17</sup> David longed for water and said, “Oh,
that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the
gate of Bethlehem!” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10692">18</sup> So the Three broke through the
Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of
Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it;
instead, he poured it out before the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-10693">19</sup> “God forbid that I should do this!”
he said. “Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the
risk of their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it
back, David would not drink it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the exploits of the three mighty
men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10694">20</sup>
Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his
spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became
as famous as the Three. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10695">21</sup> He was doubly honored above the Three
and became their commander, even though he was not included among
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10696">22</sup>
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who
performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab’s best men. He
also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10697">23</sup> And he struck
down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10697d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> tall. Although the Egyptian had a
spear like a weaver’s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him
with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and
killed him with his own spear. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10698">24</sup> Such were the exploits of Benaiah son
of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10699">25</sup> He was held in
greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among
the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</p>
