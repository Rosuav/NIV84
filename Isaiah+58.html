<h4>Isaiah 58</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">True Fasting</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18788">1</sup> “Shout it
aloud, do not hold back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise your voice like a trumpet.<br>
Declare to my people their rebellion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the house of Jacob their sins.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18789">2</sup> For day after
day they seek me out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they seem eager to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that does what is right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has not forsaken the commands of its God.<br>
They ask me for just decisions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and seem eager for God to come near them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18790">3</sup> ‘Why have we
fasted,’ they say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘and you have not seen it?<br>
Why have we humbled ourselves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have not noticed?’
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you
please<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and exploit all your workers.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18791">4</sup> Your fasting
ends in quarreling and strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in striking each other with wicked fists.<br>
You cannot fast as you do today<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and expect your voice to be heard on high.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18792">5</sup> Is this the
kind of fast I have chosen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only a day for a man to humble himself?<br>
Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for lying on sackcloth and ashes?<br>
Is that what you call a fast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18793">6</sup> “Is
not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:<br>
to loose the chains of injustice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and untie the cords of the yoke,<br>
to set the oppressed free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and break every yoke?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18794">7</sup> Is it not to
share your food with the hungry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to provide the poor wanderer with
shelter—<br>
when you see the naked, to clothe him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not to turn away from your own flesh and
blood?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18795">8</sup> Then your light
will break forth like the dawn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your healing will quickly appear;<br>
then your righteousness<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18795a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> will go
before you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory of the LORD will be your rear
guard.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18796">9</sup> Then you will
call, and the LORD will answer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am
I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you do away with the yoke of
oppression,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the pointing finger and malicious talk,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18797">10</sup> and if you
spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and satisfy the needs of the oppressed,<br>
then your light will rise in the darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your night will become like the noonday.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18798">11</sup> The LORD will
guide you always;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched
land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will strengthen your frame.<br>
You will be like a well-watered garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a spring whose waters never fail.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18799">12</sup> Your people
will rebuild the ancient ruins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will raise up the age-old foundations;<br>
you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18800">13</sup> “If
you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from doing as you please on my holy day,<br>
if you call the Sabbath a delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the LORD’s holy day honorable,<br>
and if you honor it by not going your own way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not doing as you please or speaking idle
words,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18801">14</sup> then you will
find your joy in the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will cause you to ride on the heights of
the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to feast on the inheritance of your father
Jacob.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
