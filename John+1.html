<h4>John 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Word Became Flesh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26036">1</sup> In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26037">2</sup> He was
with God in the beginning.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26038">3</sup>
Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that
has been made. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26039">4</sup>
In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26040">5</sup> The light shines in the
darkness, but the darkness has not understood<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26040a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26041">6</sup> There
came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26042">7</sup> He came as a witness to
testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might
believe. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26043">8</sup> He
himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26044">9</sup> The true light
that gives light to every man was coming into the world.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26044b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26045">10</sup> He
was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the
world did not recognize him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26046">11</sup> He came to that which was his own, but
his own did not receive him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26047">12</sup> Yet to all who received him, to those
who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of
God— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26048">13</sup> children
born not of natural descent,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26048c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> nor of
human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26049">14</sup> The
Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his
glory, the glory of the One and Only,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26049d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> who came from the Father, full of
grace and truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26050">15</sup> John
testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, “This was he of
whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was
before me.’” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26051">16</sup>
From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing
after another. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26052">17</sup>
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through
Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26053">18</sup>
No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26053e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup><sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26053f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> who is at
the Father’s side, has made him known.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist Denies Being the
Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26054">19</sup> Now this
was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and
Levites to ask him who he was. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26055">20</sup> He did not fail to confess, but
confessed freely, “I am not the Christ.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26055g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26056">21</sup> They
asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “I am not.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you the Prophet?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, “No.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26057">22</sup>
Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to
those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26058">23</sup> John
replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one
calling in the desert, ‘Make straight the way for the
Lord.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26058h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26059">24</sup> Now
some Pharisees who had been sent <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26060">25</sup> questioned him, “Why then do you
baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the
Prophet?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26061">26</sup> “I
baptize with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26061i"
title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> water,” John replied, “but
among you stands one you do not know. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26062">27</sup> He is the one who comes after me, the
thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26063">28</sup> This
all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus the Lamb of God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26064">29</sup> The next
day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26065">30</sup> This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A
man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26066">31</sup> I myself did
not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that
he might be revealed to Israel.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26067">32</sup> Then
John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven
as a dove and remain on him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26068">33</sup> I would not have known him, except that
the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom
you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with
the Holy Spirit.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26069">34</sup> I have seen and I testify that this is
the Son of God.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ First Disciples</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26070">35</sup> The next
day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26071">36</sup> When he saw Jesus passing
by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26072">37</sup> When
the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26073">38</sup> Turning
around, Jesus saw them following and asked, <font class='woj'>“What
do you want?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher),
“where are you staying?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26074">39</sup> “Come,”</font> he replied, <font class=
'woj'>“and you will see.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they went and saw where he was staying, and
spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26075">40</sup>
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what
John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26076">41</sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find
his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that
is, the Christ). <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26077">42</sup> And he brought him to Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus looked at him and said, <font class=
'woj'>“You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas”</font>
(which, when translated, is Peter<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26077j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup>).</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26078">43</sup> The next
day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to
him, <font class='woj'>“Follow me.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26079">44</sup>
Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26080">45</sup> Philip found
Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in
the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26081">46</sup>
“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come and see,” said Philip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26082">47</sup> When
Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, <font class=
'woj'>“Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing
false.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26083">48</sup> “How
do you know me?” Nathanael asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“I saw you
while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called
you.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26084">49</sup> Then
Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the
King of Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26085">50</sup> Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“You believe<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26085k" title="See footnote k">k</a>]</sup> because I
told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things
than that.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26086">51</sup> He then added, <font class='woj'>“I
tell you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26086l" title=
"See footnote l">l</a>]</sup> the truth, you<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26086m" title=
"See footnote m">m</a>]</sup> shall see heaven open, and the angels
of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</font></p>
