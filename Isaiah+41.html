<h4>Isaiah 41</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Helper of Israel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18453">1</sup> “Be silent before me, you islands! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the nations renew their strength! <br />Let them come forward and speak; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us meet together at the place of judgment. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18454">2</sup> “Who has stirred up one from the east, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling him in righteousness to his service<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18454a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>? <br />He hands nations over to him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and subdues kings before him. <br />He turns them to dust with his sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to windblown chaff with his bow. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18455">3</sup> He pursues them and moves on unscathed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a path his feet have not traveled before. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18456">4</sup> Who has done this and carried it through, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling forth the generations from the beginning? <br />I, the LORD—with the first of them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the last—I am he.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18457">5</sup> The islands have seen it and fear; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ends of the earth tremble. <br />They approach and come forward; <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18458">6</sup> each helps the other <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says to his brother, “Be strong!” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18459">7</sup> The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who smooths with the hammer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spurs on him who strikes the anvil. <br />He says of the welding, “It is good.” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nails down the idol so it will not topple. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18460">8</sup> “But you, O Israel, my servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob, whom I have chosen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you descendants of Abraham my friend, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18461">9</sup> I took you from the ends of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from its farthest corners I called you. <br />I said, ‘You are my servant’; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen you and have not rejected you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18462">10</sup> So do not fear, for I am with you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not be dismayed, for I am your God. <br />I will strengthen you and help you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18463">11</sup> “All who rage against you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will surely be ashamed and disgraced; <br />those who oppose you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be as nothing and perish. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18464">12</sup> Though you search for your enemies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will not find them. <br />Those who wage war against you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be as nothing at all. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18465">13</sup> For I am the LORD, your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who takes hold of your right hand <br />and says to you, Do not fear; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will help you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18466">14</sup> Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O little Israel, <br />for I myself will help you,” declares the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18467">15</sup> “See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new and sharp, with many teeth. <br />You will thresh the mountains and crush them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reduce the hills to chaff. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18468">16</sup> You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a gale will blow them away. <br />But you will rejoice in the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and glory in the Holy One of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18469">17</sup> “The poor and needy search for water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is none; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their tongues are parched with thirst. <br />But I the LORD will answer them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18470">18</sup> I will make rivers flow on barren heights, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and springs within the valleys. <br />I will turn the desert into pools of water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the parched ground into springs. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18471">19</sup> I will put in the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. <br />I will set pines in the wasteland, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fir and the cypress together, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18472">20</sup> so that people may see and know, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may consider and understand, <br />that the hand of the LORD has done this, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Holy One of Israel has created it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18473">21</sup> “Present your case,” says the LORD. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Set forth your arguments,” says Jacob’s King. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18474">22</sup> “Bring in your idols to tell us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is going to happen. <br />Tell us what the former things were, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we may consider them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and know their final outcome. <br />Or declare to us the things to come, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18475">23</sup> tell us what the future holds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we may know that you are gods. <br />Do something, whether good or bad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18476">24</sup> But you are less than nothing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your works are utterly worthless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who chooses you is detestable. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18477">25</sup> “I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one from the rising sun who calls on my name. <br />He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if he were a potter treading the clay. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18478">26</sup> Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or beforehand, so we could say, ‘He was right’? <br />No one told of this, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one foretold it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one heard any words from you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18479">27</sup> I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Look, here they are!’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18480">28</sup> I look but there is no one— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one among them to give counsel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one to give answer when I ask them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18481">29</sup> See, they are all false! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their deeds amount to nothing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their images are but wind and confusion. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18454a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18454" title="Ir a Isaiah 41:2">Isaiah 41:2</a> Or <i>/ whom victory meets at every step</i></li>
