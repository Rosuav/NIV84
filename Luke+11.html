<p><h4>Luke 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Teaching on Prayer</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25399">1</sup> One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25400">2</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“When you pray, say:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘Father,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25400a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font> <br /><font class='woj'>hallowed be your name,</font> <br /><font class='woj'>your kingdom come.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25400b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font> <br /><font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25401">3</sup> Give us each day our daily bread.</font> <br /><font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25402">4</sup> Forgive us our sins,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25402c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <br /><font class='woj'>And lead us not into temptation.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25402d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>’”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25403">5</sup> Then he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25404">6</sup> because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25405">7</sup> “Then the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25406">8</sup> I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man’s boldness<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25406e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25407">9</sup> “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25408">10</sup> For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25409">11</sup> “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25409f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> a fish, will give him a snake instead?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25410">12</sup> Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25411">13</sup> If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus and Beelzebub</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25412">14</sup> Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25413">15</sup> But some of them said, “By Beelzebub,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25413g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25414">16</sup> Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25415">17</sup> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: <font class='woj'>“Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25416">18</sup> If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25417">19</sup> Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25418">20</sup> But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25419">21</sup> “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25420">22</sup> But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25421">23</sup> “He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25422">24</sup> “When an evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25422h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25423">25</sup> When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25424">26</sup> Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25425">27</sup> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25426">28</sup> He replied, <font class='woj'>“Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Sign of Jonah</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25427">29</sup> As the crowds increased, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25428">30</sup> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25429">31</sup> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now one<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25429i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> greater than Solomon is here.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25430">32</sup> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Lamp of the Body</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25431">33</sup> “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25432">34</sup> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25433">35</sup> See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25434">36</sup> Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Six Woes</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25435">37</sup> When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25436">38</sup> But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25437">39</sup> Then the Lord said to him, <font class='woj'>“Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25438">40</sup> You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25439">41</sup> But give what is inside the dish<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25439j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25440">42</sup> “Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25441">43</sup> “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25442">44</sup> “Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25443">45</sup> One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25444">46</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25445">47</sup> “Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25446">48</sup> So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25447">49</sup> Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25448">50</sup> Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25449">51</sup> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25450">52</sup> “Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25451">53</sup> When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25452">54</sup> waiting to catch him in something he might say. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-25400a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-25400" title="Go to Luke 11:2">Luke 11:2</a> Some manuscripts <i>Our Father in heaven</i></li>
