<p><h4>Isaiah 56</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Salvation for Others</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18755">1</sup> This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maintain justice <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do what is right, <br />for my salvation is close at hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my righteousness will soon be revealed. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18756">2</sup> Blessed is the man who does this, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the man who holds it fast, <br />who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and keeps his hand from doing any evil.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18757">3</sup> Let no foreigner who has bound himself to the LORD say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The LORD will surely exclude me from his people.” <br />And let not any eunuch complain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am only a dry tree.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18758">4</sup> For this is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who choose what pleases me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hold fast to my covenant— <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18759">5</sup> to them I will give within my temple and its walls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a memorial and a name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better than sons and daughters; <br />I will give them an everlasting name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not be cut off. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18760">6</sup> And foreigners who bind themselves to the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to serve him, <br />to love the name of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to worship him, <br />all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who hold fast to my covenant— <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18761">7</sup> these I will bring to my holy mountain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give them joy in my house of prayer. <br />Their burnt offerings and sacrifices <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be accepted on my altar; <br />for my house will be called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a house of prayer for all nations.” <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18762">8</sup> The Sovereign LORD declares— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who gathers the exiles of Israel: <br />“I will gather still others to them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besides those already gathered.” <h5 class="passage-header">God’s Accusation Against the Wicked</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18763">9</sup> Come, all you beasts of the field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come and devour, all you beasts of the forest! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18764">10</sup> Israel’s watchmen are blind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all lack knowledge; <br />they are all mute dogs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cannot bark; <br />they lie around and dream, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they love to sleep. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18765">11</sup> They are dogs with mighty appetites; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they never have enough. <br />They are shepherds who lack understanding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all turn to their own way, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each seeks his own gain. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18766">12</sup> “Come,” each one cries, “let me get wine! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us drink our fill of beer! <br />And tomorrow will be like today, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or even far better.” </p></div></body></html>
