<h4>2 Timothy 4</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29856">1</sup> In the
presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and
the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you
this charge: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29857">2</sup>
Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct,
rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29858">3</sup> For the time
will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to
suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number
of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29859">4</sup> They will turn
their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29860">5</sup> But you, keep your head in
all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist,
discharge all the duties of your ministry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29861">6</sup> For I
am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has
come for my departure. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29862">7</sup> I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the race, I have kept the faith. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29863">8</sup> Now there is in store for me the crown
of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award
to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have
longed for his appearing.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Personal Remarks</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29864">9</sup> Do your
best to come to me quickly, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29865">10</sup> for Demas, because he loved this world,
has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to
Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29866">11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and
bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29867">12</sup> I sent
Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29868">13</sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I
left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the
parchments.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29869">14</sup>
Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord
will repay him for what he has done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29870">15</sup> You too should be on your guard against
him, because he strongly opposed our message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29871">16</sup> At my
first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me.
May it not be held against them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29872">17</sup> But the Lord stood at my side and gave
me strength, so that through me the message might be fully
proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered
from the lion’s mouth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29873">18</sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil
attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be
glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29874">19</sup> Greet
Priscilla<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29874a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and Aquila and the household
of Onesiphorus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29875">20</sup> Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left
Trophimus sick in Miletus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29876">21</sup> Do your best to get here before winter.
Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the
brothers.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29877">22</sup> The
Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</p>
