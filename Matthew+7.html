<h4>Matthew 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Judging Others</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23318">1</sup>
<font class='woj'>“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23319">2</sup> For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be
measured to you.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23320">3</sup> “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust
in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own
eye?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23321">4</sup> How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me
take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank
in your own eye?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23322">5</sup> You hypocrite, first take the plank out
of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
from your brother’s eye.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23323">6</sup> “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not
throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under
their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ask, Seek, Knock</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23324">7</sup> “Ask and it will be given to you; seek
and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23325">8</sup> For everyone who asks receives; he who
seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23326">9</sup> “Which of you, if his son asks for
bread, will give him a stone?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23327">10</sup> Or if he asks for a fish,
will give him a snake?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23328">11</sup> If you, then, though you
are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask
him!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23329">12</sup> So in everything, do to others what you
would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the
Prophets.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Narrow and Wide Gates</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23330">13</sup> “Enter through the narrow gate. For
wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction,
and many enter through it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23331">14</sup> But small is the gate and
narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Tree and Its Fruit</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23332">15</sup> “Watch out for false prophets. They
come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious
wolves.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23333">16</sup> By their fruit you will recognize them.
Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from
thistles?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23334">17</sup> Likewise every good tree bears good
fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23335">18</sup> A good
tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good
fruit.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23336">19</sup> Every tree that does not bear good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23337">20</sup> Thus, by
their fruit you will recognize them.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23338">21</sup> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord,
Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the
will of my Father who is in heaven.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23339">22</sup> Many
will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in
your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many
miracles?’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23340">23</sup> Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never
knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Wise and Foolish Builders</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23341">24</sup> “Therefore everyone who hears these
words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who
built his house on the rock.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23342">25</sup> The rain came down, the
streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet
it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23343">26</sup> But everyone who hears these words of
mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who
built his house on sand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23344">27</sup> The rain came down, the
streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and
it fell with a great crash.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23345">28</sup> When
Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at
his teaching, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23346">29</sup>
because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their
teachers of the law.</p>
