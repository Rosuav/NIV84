<h4>Job 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Prologue</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12871">1</sup> In the
land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was
blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12872">2</sup> He had seven sons and
three daughters, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12873">3</sup> and he owned seven thousand sheep, three
thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred
donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest
man among all the people of the East.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12874">4</sup> His
sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they
would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12875">5</sup> When a period
of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them
purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering
for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and
cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Job’s First Test</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12876">6</sup> One day
the angels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12876a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-12876b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> also
came with them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12877">7</sup>
The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming through
the earth and going back and forth in it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12878">8</sup> Then
the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There
is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who
fears God and shuns evil.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12879">9</sup> “Does
Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12880">10</sup> “Have you not put a hedge around him
and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work
of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout
the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12881">11</sup> But
stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will
surely curse you to your face.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12882">12</sup> The
LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your
hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Satan went out from the presence of the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12883">13</sup> One
day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine
at the oldest brother’s house, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12884">14</sup> a messenger came to Job and said, “The
oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12885">15</sup> and the Sabeans attacked
and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am
the only one who has escaped to tell you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12886">16</sup> While
he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire
of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants,
and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12887">17</sup> While
he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The
Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your
camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword,
and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12888">18</sup> While
he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your
sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest
brother’s house, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12889">19</sup> when suddenly a mighty wind swept in
from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It
collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has
escaped to tell you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12890">20</sup> At
this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he
fell to the ground in worship <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12891">21</sup> and said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and naked I will depart.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12891c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup><br>
The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may the name of the LORD be praised.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12892">22</sup> In
all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</p>
