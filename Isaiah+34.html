<h4>Isaiah 34</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Judgment Against the Nations</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18305">1</sup> Come
near, you nations, and listen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay attention, you peoples!<br>
Let the earth hear, and all that is in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world, and all that comes out of it!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18306">2</sup> The LORD is
angry with all nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wrath is upon all their armies.<br>
He will totally destroy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18306a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will give them over to slaughter.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18307">3</sup> Their slain
will be thrown out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their dead bodies will send up a stench;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mountains will be soaked with their
blood.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18308">4</sup> All the stars
of the heavens will be dissolved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sky rolled up like a scroll;<br>
all the starry host will fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like withered leaves from the vine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like shriveled figs from the fig tree.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18309">5</sup> My
sword has drunk its fill in the heavens;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see, it descends in judgment on Edom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people I have totally destroyed.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18310">6</sup> The sword of
the LORD is bathed in blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is covered with fat—<br>
the blood of lambs and goats,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fat from the kidneys of rams.<br>
For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a great slaughter in Edom.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18311">7</sup> And the wild
oxen will fall with them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bull calves and the great bulls.<br>
Their land will be drenched with blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the dust will be soaked with fat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18312">8</sup> For
the LORD has a day of vengeance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s
cause.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18313">9</sup> Edom’s streams
will be turned into pitch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her dust into burning sulfur;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her land will become blazing pitch!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18314">10</sup> It will not be
quenched night and day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its smoke will rise forever.<br>
From generation to generation it will lie desolate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will ever pass through it again.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18315">11</sup> The desert
owl<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18315b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and screech owl<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18315c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> will possess it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great owl<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18315d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and
the raven will nest there.<br>
God will stretch out over Edom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the measuring line of chaos<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the plumb line of desolation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18316">12</sup> Her nobles
will have nothing there to be called a kingdom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her princes will vanish away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18317">13</sup> Thorns will
overrun her citadels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nettles and brambles her strongholds.<br>
She will become a haunt for jackals,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a home for owls.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18318">14</sup> Desert
creatures will meet with hyenas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wild goats will bleat to each other;<br>
there the night creatures will also repose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and find for themselves places of rest.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18319">15</sup> The owl will
nest there and lay eggs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will hatch them, and care for her young under
the shadow of her wings;<br>
there also the falcons will gather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each with its mate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18320">16</sup> Look
in the scroll of the LORD and read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these will be missing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one will lack her mate.<br>
For it is his mouth that has given the order,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his Spirit will gather them together.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18321">17</sup> He allots
their portions;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand distributes them by measure.<br>
They will possess it forever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dwell there from generation to
generation.</p>
