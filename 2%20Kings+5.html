<h4>2 Kings 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Naaman Healed of Leprosy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9649">1</sup> Now Naaman
was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man
in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him
the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but
he had leprosy.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9649a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9650">2</sup> Now
bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl
from Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9651">3</sup> She said to her mistress, “If only my
master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him
of his leprosy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9652">4</sup> Naaman
went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9653">5</sup> “By all means,
go,” the king of Aram replied. “I will send a letter to the king of
Israel.” So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9653b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of silver, six thousand
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9653c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of gold and ten sets of clothing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9654">6</sup> The letter that
he took to the king of Israel read: “With this letter I am sending
my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his
leprosy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9655">7</sup> As soon
as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said,
“Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow
send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying
to pick a quarrel with me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9656">8</sup> When
Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his
robes, he sent him this message: “Why have you torn your robes?
Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in
Israel.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9657">9</sup> So
Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of
Elisha’s house. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9658">10</sup>
Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, “Go, wash yourself seven
times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will
be cleansed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9659">11</sup> But
Naaman went away angry and said, “I thought that he would surely
come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God,
wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9660">12</sup> Are not Abana and Pharpar,
the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel?
Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went off
in a rage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9661">13</sup>
Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “My father, if the prophet
had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?
How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’!”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9662">14</sup> So he went down
and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had
told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of
a young boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9663">15</sup> Then
Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood
before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the
world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your
servant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9664">16</sup> The
prophet answered, “As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I
will not accept a thing.” And even though Naaman urged him, he
refused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9665">17</sup> “If
you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given
as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will
never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god
but the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9666">18</sup>
But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my
master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on
my arm and I bow there also—when I bow down in the temple of
Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9667">19</sup> “Go in
peace,” Elisha said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Naaman had traveled some distance,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9668">20</sup> Gehazi, the
servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “My master was
too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he
brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get
something from him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9669">21</sup> So
Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward
him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. “Is everything all
right?” he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9670">22</sup>
“Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to
say, ‘Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come
to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a
talent<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9670d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of silver and two sets of
clothing.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9671">23</sup> “By
all means, take two talents,” said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to
accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two
bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his
servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9672">24</sup> When Gehazi came to the
hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the
house. He sent the men away and they left. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9673">25</sup> Then he went in and stood before his
master Elisha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where have you been, Gehazi?” Elisha
asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your servant didn’t go anywhere,” Gehazi
answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9674">26</sup> But
Elisha said to him, “Was not my spirit with you when the man got
down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money,
or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or
menservants and maidservants? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9675">27</sup> Naaman’s leprosy will cling to you and
to your descendants forever.” Then Gehazi went from Elisha’s
presence and he was leprous, as white as snow.</p>
