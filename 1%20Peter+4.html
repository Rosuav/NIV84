<h4>1 Peter 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Living for God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30432">1</sup>
Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also
with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is
done with sin. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30433">2</sup>
As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil
human desires, but rather for the will of God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30434">3</sup> For you have spent enough
time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in
debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable
idolatry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30435">4</sup> They
think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same
flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30436">5</sup> But they will have to give
account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30437">6</sup> For this is the
reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so
that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body,
but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30438">7</sup> The
end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and
self-controlled so that you can pray. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30439">8</sup> Above all, love each other deeply,
because love covers over a multitude of sins. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30440">9</sup> Offer hospitality to one another
without grumbling. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30441">10</sup> Each one should use whatever gift he
has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace
in its various forms. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30442">11</sup> If anyone speaks, he should do it as
one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do
it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be
praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Suffering for Being a Christian</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30443">12</sup> Dear
friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are
suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30444">13</sup> But rejoice
that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may
be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30445">14</sup> If you are insulted because of the name
of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God
rests on you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30446">15</sup>
If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other
kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30447">16</sup> However, if you suffer as a Christian,
do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30448">17</sup> For it is time
for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with
us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel
of God? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30449">18</sup> And,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If it is hard for the righteous to be
saved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what will become of the ungodly and the
sinner?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30449a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30450">19</sup> So
then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit
themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.</p>
