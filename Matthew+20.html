<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Workers in the
Vineyard</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23792">1</sup>
<font class='woj'>“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his
vineyard.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23793">2</sup> He agreed to pay them a denarius for the
day and sent them into his vineyard.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23794">3</sup> “About the third hour he went out and
saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23795">4</sup> He told them, ‘You also go and work in
my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23796">5</sup> So they went.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“He went out again about the
sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23797">6</sup> About the eleventh hour he went out and
found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you
been standing here all day long doing nothing?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23798">7</sup> “‘Because no one has hired us,’ they
answered.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“He said to them, ‘You also
go and work in my vineyard.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23799">8</sup> “When evening came, the owner of the
vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their
wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the
first.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23800">9</sup> “The workers who were hired about the
eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23801">10</sup> So when those came who were hired
first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also
received a denarius.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23802">11</sup> When they received it, they began to
grumble against the landowner.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23803">12</sup> ‘These men who were hired
last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them
equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of
the day.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23804">13</sup> “But he answered one of them, ‘Friend,
I am not being unfair to you. Didn’t you agree to work for a
denarius?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23805">14</sup> Take your pay and go. I want to give
the man who was hired last the same as I gave you.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23806">15</sup> Don’t I have the right to do what I
want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am
generous?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23807">16</sup> “So the last will be first, and the
first will be last.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Again Predicts His Death</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23808">17</sup> Now as
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside
and said to them, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23809">18</sup> “We are going up to Jerusalem, and the
Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers
of the law. They will condemn him to death</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23810">19</sup> and will
turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and
crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!”</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Mother’s Request</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23811">20</sup> Then the
mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling
down, asked a favor of him.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23812">21</sup> “What is it you want?”</font> he
asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, “Grant that one of these two sons of
mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your
kingdom.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23813">22</sup> “You don’t know what you are
asking,”</font> Jesus said to them. <font class='woj'>“Can you
drink the cup I am going to drink?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We can,” they answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23814">23</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“You will indeed drink from my cup,
but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places
belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my
Father.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23815">24</sup> When
the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two
brothers. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23816">25</sup>
Jesus called them together and said, <font class='woj'>“You know
that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high
officials exercise authority over them.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23817">26</sup> Not so
with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be
your servant,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23818">27</sup> and whoever wants to be first must be
your slave—</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23819">28</sup> just as the Son of Man did not come to
be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Two Blind Men Receive Sight</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23820">29</sup> As Jesus
and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23821">30</sup> Two blind men
were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was
going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23822">31</sup> The
crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all
the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23823">32</sup> Jesus
stopped and called them. <font class='woj'>“What do you want me to
do for you?”</font> he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23824">33</sup>
“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23825">34</sup> Jesus
had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they
received their sight and followed him.</p>
