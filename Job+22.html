<h4>Job 22</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Eliphaz</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13391">1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13392">2</sup> “Can a man be of benefit to God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can even a wise man benefit him? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13393">3</sup> What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would he gain if your ways were blameless? <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13394">4</sup> “Is it for your piety that he rebukes you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings charges against you? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13395">5</sup> Is not your wickedness great? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not your sins endless? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13396">6</sup> You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13397">7</sup> You gave no water to the weary <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you withheld food from the hungry, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13398">8</sup> though you were a powerful man, owning land— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an honored man, living on it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13399">9</sup> And you sent widows away empty-handed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and broke the strength of the fatherless. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13400">10</sup> That is why snares are all around you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why sudden peril terrifies you, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13401">11</sup> why it is so dark you cannot see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and why a flood of water covers you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13402">12</sup> “Is not God in the heights of heaven? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see how lofty are the highest stars! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13403">13</sup> Yet you say, ‘What does God know? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he judge through such darkness? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13404">14</sup> Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13405">15</sup> Will you keep to the old path <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that evil men have trod? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13406">16</sup> They were carried off before their time, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their foundations washed away by a flood. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13407">17</sup> They said to God, ‘Leave us alone! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Almighty do to us?’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13408">18</sup> Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13409">19</sup> “The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the innocent mock them, saying, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13410">20</sup> ‘Surely our foes are destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire devours their wealth.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13411">21</sup> “Submit to God and be at peace with him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this way prosperity will come to you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13412">22</sup> Accept instruction from his mouth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay up his words in your heart. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13413">23</sup> If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remove wickedness far from your tent <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13414">24</sup> and assign your nuggets to the dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13415">25</sup> then the Almighty will be your gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the choicest silver for you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13416">26</sup> Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will lift up your face to God. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13417">27</sup> You will pray to him, and he will hear you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will fulfill your vows. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13418">28</sup> What you decide on will be done, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and light will shine on your ways. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13419">29</sup> When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then he will save the downcast. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13420">30</sup> He will deliver even one who is not innocent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.” </div></body></html>
