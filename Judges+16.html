<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6951" class="text Judg-16-1">Samson and
Delilah</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-1"><span class=
"chapternum">16&nbsp;</span>One day Samson went to Gaza, where he
saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6952" class="text Judg-16-2"><sup class=
"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The people of Gaza were told, “Samson is
here!” So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all
night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying,
“At dawn we’ll kill him.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6953" class="text Judg-16-3"><sup class=
"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>But Samson lay there only until the middle
of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city
gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and
all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of
the hill that faces Hebron. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6954" class="text Judg-16-4"><sup class=
"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Some time later, he fell in love with a
woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6955" class="text Judg-16-5"><sup class=
"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The rulers of the Philistines went to her
and said, “See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of
his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him
up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6955a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of silver.” </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6956" class="text Judg-16-6"><sup class=
"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me the
secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and
subdued.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6957" class="text Judg-16-7"><sup class=
"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Samson answered her, “If anyone ties me
with seven fresh thongs<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6957b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> that have
not been dried, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6958" class="text Judg-16-8"><sup class=
"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the rulers of the Philistines brought
her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him
with them.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6959" class=
"text Judg-16-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>With men hidden
in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon
you!” But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string
snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength
was not discovered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6960" class="text Judg-16-10"><sup class=
"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have
made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be
tied.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6961" class="text Judg-16-11"><sup class=
"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>He said, “If anyone ties me securely with
new ropes that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as any
other man.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6962" class="text Judg-16-12"><sup class=
"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>So Delilah took new ropes and tied him
with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him,
“Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the ropes
off his arms as if they were threads.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6963" class="text Judg-16-13"><sup class=
"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Delilah then said to Samson, “Until now,
you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you
can be tied.”</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-13">He replied, “If you weave the
seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it
with the pin, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” So while he
was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them
into the fabric</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6964" class=
"text Judg-16-14"><sup class=
"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>and<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6964c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> tightened
it with the pin.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-14">Again she called to him, “Samson,
the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled
up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6965" class="text Judg-16-15"><sup class=
"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I
love you,’ when you won’t confide in me? This is the third time you
have made a fool of me and haven’t told me the secret of your great
strength. ”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6966" class=
"text Judg-16-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>With such
nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to
death.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6967" class="text Judg-16-17"><sup class=
"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>So he told her everything. “No razor has
ever been used on my head,” he said, “because I have been a
Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my
strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other
man.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6968" class="text Judg-16-18"><sup class=
"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When Delilah saw that he had told her
everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines , “Come
back once more; he has told me everything.” So the rulers of the
Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6969" class="text Judg-16-19"><sup class=
"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Having put him to sleep on her lap, she
called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so
began to subdue him.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6969d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> And his
strength left him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6970" class="text Judg-16-20"><sup class=
"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Then she called, “Samson, the Philistines
are upon you!” </span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-20">He awoke from his sleep and
thought, “I’ll go out as before and shake myself free.” But he did
not know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> had left him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6971" class="text Judg-16-21"><sup class=
"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Then the Philistines seized him, gouged
out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze
shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6972" class="text Judg-16-22"><sup class=
"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>But the hair on his head began to grow
again after it had been shaved.</span></p>
<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6973" class="text Judg-16-23">The Death of
Samson</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-23"><sup class=
"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Now the rulers of the Philistines
assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to
celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into
our hands.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6974" class="text Judg-16-24"><sup class=
"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>When the people saw him, they praised
their god, saying,</span></p>

<p class="line"><span class="text Judg-16-24">“Our god has
delivered our enemy</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class=

<span class="text Judg-16-24">the one who laid waste our
land</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class=

</div>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6975" class="text Judg-16-25"><sup class=
"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>While they were in high spirits, they
shouted, “Bring out Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson
out of the prison, and he performed for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-16-25">When they stood him among the
pillars,</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6976" class=
"text Judg-16-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Samson said
to the servant who held his hand, “Put me where I can feel the
pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against
them.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6977" class=
"text Judg-16-27"><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Now the
temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the
Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand
men and women watching Samson perform.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6978" class="text Judg-16-28"><sup class=
"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then Samson prayed to the <span style=
"font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord,</span> “O
Sovereign <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord,</span> remember me. O God, please strengthen me
just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the
Philistines for my two eyes.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6979"
class="text Judg-16-29"><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Then
Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple
stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and
his left hand on the other,</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6980"
class="text Judg-16-30"><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Samson
said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all
his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the
people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he
lived.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6981" class="text Judg-16-31"><sup class=
"versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Then his brothers and his father’s whole
family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him
between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had
