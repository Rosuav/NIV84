<h4>2 Samuel 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David and Ziba</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8428">1</sup> When David
had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the
steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of
donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a
hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of
wine.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8429">2</sup> The
king asked Ziba, “Why have you brought these?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s
household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat,
and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the
desert.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8430">3</sup> The
king then asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba said to him, “He is staying in Jerusalem,
because he thinks, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back my
grandfather’s kingdom.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8431">4</sup> Then
the king said to Ziba, “All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now
yours.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I humbly bow,” Ziba said. “May I find favor
in your eyes, my lord the king.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Shimei Curses David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8432">5</sup> As King
David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul’s family
came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed
as he came out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8433">6</sup>
He pelted David and all the king’s officials with stones, though
all the troops and the special guard were on David’s right and
left. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8434">7</sup> As he
cursed, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you man of blood, you
scoundrel! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8435">8</sup> The
LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of
Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The LORD has handed the
kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you
are a man of blood!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8436">9</sup> Then
Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog
curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8437">10</sup> But
the king said, “What do you and I have in common, you sons of
Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, ‘Curse
David,’ who can ask, ‘Why do you do this?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8438">11</sup> David
then said to Abishai and all his officials, “My son, who is of my
own flesh, is trying to take my life. How much more, then, this
Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told
him to. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8439">12</sup> It may
be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for
the cursing I am receiving today.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8440">13</sup> So
David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going
along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing
stones at him and showering him with dirt. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8441">14</sup> The king and all the people with him
arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed
himself.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Advice of Ahithophel and Hushai</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8442">15</sup>
Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and
Ahithophel was with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8443">16</sup> Then Hushai the Arkite, David’s friend,
went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the
king!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8444">17</sup>
Absalom asked Hushai, “Is this the love you show your friend? Why
didn’t you go with your friend?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8445">18</sup> Hushai
said to Absalom, “No, the one chosen by the LORD, by these people,
and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and I will remain with
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8446">19</sup>
Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just
as I served your father, so I will serve you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8447">20</sup>
Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we
do?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8448">21</sup>
Ahithophel answered, “Lie with your father’s concubines whom he
left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you
have made yourself a stench in your father’s nostrils, and the
hands of everyone with you will be strengthened.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8449">22</sup> So they pitched a tent for
Absalom on the roof, and he lay with his father’s concubines in the
sight of all Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8450">23</sup> Now in
those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who
inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all
of Ahithophel’s advice.</p>
