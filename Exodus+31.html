<h4>Exodus 31</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Bezalel and Oholiab</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2422">1</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2423">2</sup> “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri,
the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2424">3</sup> and I have filled him with the Spirit of
God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2425">4</sup> to make artistic
designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2426">5</sup> to cut and set stones, to work in
wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2427">6</sup> Moreover, I have appointed
Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I
have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have
commanded you: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2428">7</sup>
the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony with the atonement
cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2429">8</sup> the table and its articles,
the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of
incense, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2430">9</sup> the
altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its
stand— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2431">10</sup> and also
the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest
and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2432">11</sup> and the
anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to
make them just as I commanded you.”
<h5 class="passage-header">The Sabbath</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2433">12</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2434">13</sup> “Say to the Israelites, ‘You must
observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the
generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes
you holy.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2434a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2435">14</sup>
“‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who
desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that
day must be cut off from his people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2436">15</sup> For six days, work is to be done, but
the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever
does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2437">16</sup> The Israelites are to
observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as
a lasting covenant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2438">17</sup> It will be a sign between me and the
Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and
the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and
rested.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2439">18</sup> When
the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the
two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the
finger of God.</p>
