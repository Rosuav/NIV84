<p><h4>Matthew 9</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23381">1</sup> Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23382">2</sup> Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <font class='woj'>“Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23383">3</sup> At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23384">4</sup> Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23385">5</sup> Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23386">6</sup> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins…”</font> Then he said to the paralytic, <font class='woj'>“Get up, take your mat and go home.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23387">7</sup> And the man got up and went home. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23388">8</sup> When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men. <h5 class="passage-header">The Calling of Matthew</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23389">9</sup> As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. <font class='woj'>“Follow me,”</font> he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23390">10</sup> While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and “sinners” came and ate with him and his disciples. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23391">11</sup> When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23392">12</sup> On hearing this, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23393">13</sup> But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23393a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23394">14</sup> Then John’s disciples came and asked him, “How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23395">15</sup> Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23396">16</sup> “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23397">17</sup> Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23398">18</sup> While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23399">19</sup> Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23400">20</sup> Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23401">21</sup> She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23402">22</sup> Jesus turned and saw her. <font class='woj'>“Take heart, daughter,”</font> he said, <font class='woj'>“your faith has healed you.”</font> And the woman was healed from that moment. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23403">23</sup> When Jesus entered the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23404">24</sup> he said, <font class='woj'>“Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.”</font> But they laughed at him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23405">25</sup> After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23406">26</sup> News of this spread through all that region. <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals the Blind and Mute</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23407">27</sup> As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23408">28</sup> When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Lord,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23409">29</sup> Then he touched their eyes and said, <font class='woj'>“According to your faith will it be done to you”;</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23410">30</sup> and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, <font class='woj'>“See that no one knows about this.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23411">31</sup> But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23412">32</sup> While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23413">33</sup> And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23414">34</sup> But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.” <h5 class="passage-header">The Workers Are Few</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23415">35</sup> Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23416">36</sup> When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23417">37</sup> Then he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23418">38</sup> Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”</font> </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-23393a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-23393" title="Go to Matthew 9:13">Matthew 9:13</a> Hosea 6:6</li>
