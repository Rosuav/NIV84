<h4>Job 14</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13183">1</sup> “Man born of woman <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is of few days and full of trouble. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13184">2</sup> He springs up like a flower and withers away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13185">3</sup> Do you fix your eye on such a one? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you bring him<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13185a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> before you for judgment? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13186">4</sup> Who can bring what is pure from the impure? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13187">5</sup> Man’s days are determined; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have decreed the number of his months <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have set limits he cannot exceed. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13188">6</sup> So look away from him and let him alone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till he has put in his time like a hired man. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13189">7</sup> “At least there is hope for a tree: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is cut down, it will sprout again, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its new shoots will not fail. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13190">8</sup> Its roots may grow old in the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its stump die in the soil, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13191">9</sup> yet at the scent of water it will bud <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put forth shoots like a plant. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13192">10</sup> But man dies and is laid low; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he breathes his last and is no more. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13193">11</sup> As water disappears from the sea <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a riverbed becomes parched and dry, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13194">12</sup> so man lies down and does not rise; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till the heavens are no more, men will not awake <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or be roused from their sleep. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13195">13</sup> “If only you would hide me in the grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13195b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and conceal me till your anger has passed! <br />If only you would set me a time <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then remember me! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13196">14</sup> If a man dies, will he live again? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the days of my hard service <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wait for my renewal<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13196c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to come. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13197">15</sup> You will call and I will answer you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will long for the creature your hands have made. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13198">16</sup> Surely then you will count my steps <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not keep track of my sin. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13199">17</sup> My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will cover over my sin. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13200">18</sup> “But as a mountain erodes and crumbles <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a rock is moved from its place, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13201">19</sup> as water wears away stones <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and torrents wash away the soil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you destroy man’s hope. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13202">20</sup> You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you change his countenance and send him away. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13203">21</sup> If his sons are honored, he does not know it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if they are brought low, he does not see it. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13204">22</sup> He feels but the pain of his own body <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mourns only for himself.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-13185a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-13185" title="Ir a Job 14:3">Job 14:3</a> Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew <i>me</i></li>
