<p><h4>Acts 19</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Paul in Ephesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27574">1</sup> While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27575">2</sup> and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27575a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> you believed?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27576">3</sup> So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“John’s baptism,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27577">4</sup> Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27578">5</sup> On hearing this, they were baptized into<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27578b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27579">6</sup> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27579c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and prophesied. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27580">7</sup> There were about twelve men in all. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27581">8</sup> Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27582">9</sup> But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27583">10</sup> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27584">11</sup> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27585">12</sup> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27586">13</sup> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27587">14</sup> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27588">15</sup> One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27589">16</sup> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27590">17</sup> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27591">18</sup> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27592">19</sup> A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27592d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27593">20</sup> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27594">21</sup> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27595">22</sup> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. <h5 class="passage-header">The Riot in Ephesus</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27596">23</sup> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27597">24</sup> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27598">25</sup> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: “Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27599">26</sup> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27600">27</sup> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27601">28</sup> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27602">29</sup> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27603">30</sup> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27604">31</sup> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27605">32</sup> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27606">33</sup> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27607">34</sup> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27608">35</sup> The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Men of Ephesus, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27609">36</sup> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27610">37</sup> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27611">38</sup> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27612">39</sup> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27613">40</sup> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today’s events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27614">41</sup> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-27575a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-27575" title="Go to Acts 19:2">Acts 19:2</a> Or <i>after</i></li>
