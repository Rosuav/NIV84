<h5 class="passage-header">A Message About Babylon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20168">1</sup> This is
the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning
Babylon and the land of the Babylonians<sup class=

"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20169">2</sup>
“Announce and proclaim among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up a banner and proclaim it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep nothing back, but say,<br>
‘Babylon will be captured;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bel will be put to shame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marduk filled with terror.<br>
Her images will be put to shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her idols filled with terror.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20170">3</sup> A nation from
the north will attack her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay waste her land.<br>
No one will live in it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both men and animals will flee away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20171">4</sup> “In
those days, at that time,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD,<br>
“the people of Israel and the people of Judah together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will go in tears to seek the LORD their God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20172">5</sup> They will ask
the way to Zion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turn their faces toward it.<br>
They will come and bind themselves to the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an everlasting covenant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20173">6</sup> “My
people have been lost sheep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their shepherds have led them astray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and caused them to roam on the mountains.<br>
They wandered over mountain and hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forgot their own resting place.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20174">7</sup> Whoever found
them devoured them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their enemies said, ‘We are not guilty,<br>
for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, the hope of their fathers.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20175">8</sup> “Flee
out of Babylon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave the land of the Babylonians,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be like the goats that lead the flock.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20176">9</sup> For I will stir
up and bring against Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alliance of great nations from the land of the
north.<br>
They will take up their positions against her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the north she will be captured.<br>
Their arrows will be like skilled warriors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who do not return empty-handed.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20177">10</sup> So
Babylonia<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20177b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> will be plundered;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who plunder her will have their fill,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20178">11</sup>
“Because you rejoice and are glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who pillage my inheritance,<br>
because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and neigh like stallions,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20179">12</sup> your mother
will be greatly ashamed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she who gave you birth will be disgraced.<br>
She will be the least of the nations—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20180">13</sup> Because of the
LORD’s anger she will not be inhabited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but will be completely desolate.<br>
All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all her wounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20181">14</sup> “Take
up your positions around Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all you who draw the bow.<br>
Shoot at her! Spare no arrows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she has sinned against the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20182">15</sup> Shout against
her on every side!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She surrenders, her towers fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her walls are torn down.<br>
Since this is the vengeance of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take vengeance on her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do to her as she has done to others.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20183">16</sup> Cut off from
Babylon the sower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the reaper with his sickle at harvest.<br>
Because of the sword of the oppressor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let everyone return to his own people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let everyone flee to his own land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20184">17</sup>
“Israel is a scattered flock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that lions have chased away.<br>
The first to devour him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the king of Assyria;<br>
the last to crush his bones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20185">18</sup>
Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel,
says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will punish the king of Babylon and his
land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I punished the king of Assyria.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20186">19</sup> But I will
bring Israel back to his own pasture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan;<br>
his appetite will be satisfied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20187">20</sup> In those days,
at that time,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD,<br>
“search will be made for Israel’s guilt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there will be none,<br>
and for the sins of Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but none will be found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I will forgive the remnant I spare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20188">21</sup>
“Attack the land of Merathaim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who live in Pekod.<br>
Pursue, kill and completely destroy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

them,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do everything I have commanded you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20189">22</sup> The noise of
battle is in the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the noise of great destruction!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20190">23</sup> How broken and
shattered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the hammer of the whole earth!<br>
How desolate is Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the nations!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20191">24</sup> I set a trap
for you, O Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you were caught before you knew it;<br>
you were found and captured<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you opposed the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20192">25</sup> The LORD has
opened his arsenal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brought out the weapons of his wrath,<br>
for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of the Babylonians.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20193">26</sup> Come against
her from afar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break open her granaries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pile her up like heaps of grain.<br>
Completely destroy her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leave her no remnant.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20194">27</sup> Kill all her
young bulls;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them go down to the slaughter!<br>
Woe to them! For their day has come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time for them to be punished.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20195">28</sup> Listen to the
fugitives and refugees from Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declaring in Zion<br>
how the LORD our God has taken vengeance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vengeance for his temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20196">29</sup>
“Summon archers against Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those who draw the bow.<br>
Encamp all around her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let no one escape.<br>
Repay her for her deeds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do to her as she has done.<br>
For she has defied the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20197">30</sup> Therefore, her
young men will fall in the streets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her soldiers will be silenced in that
day,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20198">31</sup> “See, I am
against you, O arrogant one,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty,<br>
“for your day has come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time for you to be punished.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20199">32</sup> The arrogant
one will stumble and fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one will help her up;<br>
I will kindle a fire in her towns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will consume all who are around her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20200">33</sup> This
is what the LORD Almighty says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The people of Israel are oppressed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the people of Judah as well.<br>
All their captors hold them fast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refusing to let them go.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20201">34</sup> Yet their
Redeemer is strong;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty is his name.<br>
He will vigorously defend their cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he may bring rest to their land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but unrest to those who live in Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20202">35</sup> “A
sword against the Babylonians!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD—<br>
“against those who live in Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and against her officials and wise men!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20203">36</sup> A sword
against her false prophets!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become fools.<br>
A sword against her warriors!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be filled with terror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20204">37</sup> A sword
against her horses and chariots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the foreigners in her ranks!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become women.<br>
A sword against her treasures!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be plundered.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20205">38</sup> A drought
on<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20205d" title=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will dry up.<br>
For it is a land of idols,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idols that will go mad with terror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20206">39</sup> “So
desert creatures and hyenas will live there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there the owl will dwell.<br>
It will never again be inhabited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lived in from generation to generation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20207">40</sup> As God
overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with their neighboring towns,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD,<br>
“so no one will live there;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man will dwell in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20208">41</sup>
“Look! An army is coming from the north;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great nation and many kings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are being stirred up from the ends of the
earth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20209">42</sup> They are armed
with bows and spears;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are cruel and without mercy.<br>
They sound like the roaring sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they ride on their horses;<br>
they come like men in battle formation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20210">43</sup> The king of
Babylon has heard reports about them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his hands hang limp.<br>
Anguish has gripped him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain like that of a woman in labor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20211">44</sup> Like a lion
coming up from Jordan’s thickets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a rich pastureland,<br>
I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the chosen one I will appoint for
this?<br>
Who is like me and who can challenge me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what shepherd can stand against me?”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20212">45</sup> Therefore,
hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what he has purposed against the land of the
Babylonians:<br>
The young of the flock will be dragged away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will completely destroy their pasture because
of them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20213">46</sup> At the sound
of Babylon’s capture the earth will tremble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its cry will resound among the nations.</p>
