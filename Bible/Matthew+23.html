&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23918">1</sup> Then
Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: <font class=

teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice
what they preach.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23921">4</sup> They tie up heavy loads and put them
on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a
finger to move them.</font>

the tassels on their garments long;</font> <font class=

the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the
synagogues;</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23924">7</sup> they love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and to have men call them ‘Rabbi.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23925">8</sup> “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’
for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23926">9</sup> And do not call anyone on earth
‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23927">10</sup> Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for
you have one Teacher, the Christ.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

servant.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23929">12</sup> For whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</font></p>

Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s
faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter
who are trying to.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23931">15</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a
single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much
a son of hell as you are.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23932">16</sup> “Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If
anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears
by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23933">17</sup> You blind fools! Which is greater: the
gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23934">18</sup> You also
say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if
anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23935">19</sup> You blind men! Which is greater: the
gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</font> <font class=

Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by
everything on it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23937">21</sup> And he who swears by the temple
swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.</font> <font class=

who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the one who sits
on it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23939">23</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint,
dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters
of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have
practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23940">24</sup> You blind guides! You strain out a gnat
but swallow a camel.</font></p>

"en-NIV1984-23941">25</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and

dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23942">26</sup> Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside
of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be
clean.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23943">27</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which
look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead
men’s bones and everything unclean.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23944">28</sup> In the
same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on
the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23945">29</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and
decorate the graves of the righteous.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23946">30</sup> And you
say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not
have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the
prophets.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23947">31</sup> So you testify against yourselves that
you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

of your forefathers!</font></p>

Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some
of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your
synagogues and pursue from town to town.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23951">35</sup> And so
upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah
son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the
altar.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23952">36</sup> I tell you the truth, all this will
come upon this generation.</font></p>

the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed
to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under
her wings, but you were not willing.</font> <font class=

your house is left to you desolate.</font> <font class=
