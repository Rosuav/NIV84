<h4>2 Corinthians 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Warnings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29029">1</sup> This will
be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the
testimony of two or three witnesses.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29029a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29030">2</sup> I already gave you a warning when I was
with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my
return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the
others, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29031">3</sup> since
you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is
not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29032">4</sup> For to be sure,
he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power.
Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with
him to serve you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29033">5</sup>
Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test
yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless,
of course, you fail the test? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29034">6</sup> And I trust that you will discover that
we have not failed the test. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29035">7</sup> Now we pray to God that you will not do
anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the
test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to
have failed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29036">8</sup>
For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the
truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29037">9</sup> We are
glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for
your perfection. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29038">10</sup> This is why I write these things when I
am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of
authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not
for tearing you down.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29039">11</sup> Finally,
brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of
one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with
you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29040">12</sup> Greet
one another with a holy kiss. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29041">13</sup> All the saints send their
greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29042">14</sup> May
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p>
