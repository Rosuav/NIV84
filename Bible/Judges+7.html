<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-6696" class="text Judg-7-1">Gideon Defeats
the Midianites</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-7-1"><span class=
"chapternum">7&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that
is, Gideon ) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The
camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of
Moreh.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6697" class=
"text Judg-7-2"><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The <span style=
"font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to
Gideon, “You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their
hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own
strength has saved her,</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6698" class=
"text Judg-7-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>announce now to
the people, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave
Mount Gilead. ’” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten
thousand remained.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6699" class="text Judg-7-4"><sup class=
"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>But the <span style=
"font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to
Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water,
and I will sift them for you there. If I say, ‘This one shall go
with you,’ he shall go; but if I say, ‘This one shall not go with
you,’ he shall not go.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6700" class="text Judg-7-5"><sup class=
"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So Gideon took the men down to the water.
There the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> told him, “Separate those who lap the
water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to
drink.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6701" class=
"text Judg-7-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Three hundred
men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down
on their knees to drink.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6702" class="text Judg-7-7"><sup class=
"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps"
class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “With the three
hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites
into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own
place.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6703" class=
"text Judg-7-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>So Gideon sent
the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three
hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the
others.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-7-8">Now the camp of Midian lay below him
in the valley.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6704" class=
"text Judg-7-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>During that
night the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “Get up, go down against
the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6705" class="text Judg-7-10"><sup class=
"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>If you are afraid to attack, go down to
the camp with your servant Purah</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6706"
class="text Judg-7-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>and
listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged
to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the
outposts of the camp.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6707" class=
"text Judg-7-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The
Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had
settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more
be counted than the sand on the seashore. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6708" class="text Judg-7-13"><sup class=
"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a
friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of
barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the
tent with such force that the tent overturned and
collapsed.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6709" class="text Judg-7-14"><sup class=
"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>His friend responded, “This can be nothing
other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has
given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6710" class="text Judg-7-15"><sup class=
"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When Gideon heard the dream and its
interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel
and called out, “Get up! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps"
class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given the Midianite camp into
your hands.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6711" class=
"text Judg-7-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Dividing the
three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and
empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches
inside.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6712" class="text Judg-7-17"><sup class=
"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>“Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead.
When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-6713" class="text Judg-7-18"><sup class=
"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When I and all who are with me blow our
trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, ‘For
the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> and for Gideon.’”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6714" class="text Judg-7-19"><sup class=
"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Gideon and the hundred men with him
reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch,
just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and
broke the jars that were in their hands.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6715" class="text Judg-7-20"><sup class=
"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>The three companies blew the trumpets and
smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and
holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they
shouted, “A sword for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps"
class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for Gideon!”</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6716" class="text Judg-7-21"><sup class=
"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>While each man held his position around
the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.
</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6717" class="text Judg-7-22"><sup class=
"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>When the three hundred trumpets sounded,
the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord</span> caused the men throughout the camp to turn
on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah
toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near
Tabbath.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6718" class=
"text Judg-7-23"><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Israelites
from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they
pursued the Midianites.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6719" class=
"text Judg-7-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Gideon sent
messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come
down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan
ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-7-24">So all the men of Ephraim were
called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth
Barah.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6720" class=
"text Judg-7-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>They also
captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb . They killed
Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They
pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon, who was by the Jordan. </span></p>
