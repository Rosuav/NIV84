<h4>Joshua 17</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6277">1</sup> This
was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn,
that is, for Makir, Manasseh’s firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of
the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the
Makirites were great soldiers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6278">2</sup> So this allotment was for the rest of the
people of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem,
Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of
Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6279">3</sup> Now
Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the
son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were
Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6280">4</sup> They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua
son of Nun, and the leaders and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to
give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So Joshua gave them an
inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to
the LORD’s command. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6281">5</sup> Manasseh’s share consisted of ten tracts
of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6282">6</sup> because the daughters of
the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The
land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of
Manasseh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6283">7</sup> The
territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Micmethath east of
Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the
people living at En Tappuah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6284">8</sup> (Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but
Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the
Ephraimites.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6285">9</sup>
Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were
towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but
the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and
ended at the sea. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6286">10</sup> On the south the land belonged to
Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh
reached the sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the
east.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6287">11</sup> Within
Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the
people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their
surrounding settlements (the third in the list is
Naphoth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-6287a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6288">12</sup> Yet
the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the
Canaanites were determined to live in that region. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6289">13</sup> However, when the
Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced
labor but did not drive them out completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6290">14</sup> The
people of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one
allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous
people and the LORD has blessed us abundantly.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6291">15</sup> “If
you are so numerous,” Joshua answered, “and if the hill country of
Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land
for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and
Rephaites.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6292">16</sup> The
people of Joseph replied, “The hill country is not enough for us,
and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have iron chariots,
both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley
of Jezreel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6293">17</sup> But
Joshua said to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are
numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6294">18</sup> but the
forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits
will be yours; though the Canaanites have iron chariots and though
they are strong, you can drive them out.”</p>
