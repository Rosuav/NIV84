<h4>Hebrews 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning to Pay Attention</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29963">1</sup> We must
pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so
that we do not drift away. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29964">2</sup> For if the message spoken by angels was
binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just
punishment, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29965">3</sup> how
shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This
salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to
us by those who heard him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29966">4</sup> God also testified to it by signs,
wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit
distributed according to his will.
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Made Like His Brothers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29967">5</sup> It is not
to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we
are speaking. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29968">6</sup>
But there is a place where someone has testified:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is man that you are mindful of him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of man that you care for him?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29969">7</sup> You made him a
little<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29969a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> lower than the angels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you crowned him with glory and honor<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29970">8</sup> and put
everything under his feet.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29970b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting everything under him, God left
nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see
everything subject to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29971">9</sup> But we see Jesus, who was made a little
lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he
suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death
for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29972">10</sup> In
bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and
through whom everything exists, should make the author of their
salvation perfect through suffering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29973">11</sup> Both the one who makes men holy and
those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not
ashamed to call them brothers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29974">12</sup> He says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will declare your name to my brothers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of the congregation I will sing
your praises.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29974c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29975">13</sup> And
again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will put my trust in him.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29975d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again he says,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here am I, and the children God has given
me.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29975e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29976">14</sup> Since
the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity
so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of
death—that is, the devil— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29977">15</sup> and free those who all their lives were
held in slavery by their fear of death. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29978">16</sup> For surely it is not angels he helps,
but Abraham’s descendants. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29979">17</sup> For this reason he had to be made like
his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make
atonement for<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29979f"
title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> the sins of the people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29980">18</sup> Because he
himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who
are being tempted.</p>
