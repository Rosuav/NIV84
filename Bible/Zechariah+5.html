<h4>Zechariah 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Flying Scroll</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22938">1</sup> I looked
again—and there before me was a flying scroll!
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22939">2</sup> He
asked me, “What do you see?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, “I see a flying scroll, thirty
feet long and fifteen feet wide.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22939a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22940">3</sup> And he
said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole
land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will
be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone
who swears falsely will be banished. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22941">4</sup> The LORD Almighty declares, ‘I will send
it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of
him who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and
destroy it, both its timbers and its stones.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Woman in a Basket</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22942">5</sup> Then the
angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up
and see what this is that is appearing.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22943">6</sup> I
asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, “It is a measuring
basket.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22943b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>” And he added, “This is the
iniquity<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22943c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> of the people throughout the
land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22944">7</sup> Then
the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22945">8</sup> He said, “This
is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed
the lead cover down over its mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22946">9</sup> Then I
looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in
their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted
up the basket between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22947">10</sup>
“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was
speaking to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22948">11</sup> He
replied, “To the country of Babylonia<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22948d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> to build a house for it. When it is
ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”</p>
