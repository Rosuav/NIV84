<h4>Isaiah 25</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Praise to the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18120">1</sup> O LORD,
you are my God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will exalt you and praise your name,<br>
for in perfect faithfulness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have done marvelous things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things planned long ago.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18121">2</sup> You have made
the city a heap of rubble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fortified town a ruin,<br>
the foreigners’ stronghold a city no more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will never be rebuilt.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18122">3</sup> Therefore
strong peoples will honor you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cities of ruthless nations will revere you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18123">4</sup> You have been a
refuge for the poor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a refuge for the needy in his distress,<br>
a shelter from the storm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a shade from the heat.<br>
For the breath of the ruthless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like a storm driving against a wall<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18124">5</sup> and like
the heat of the desert.<br>
You silence the uproar of foreigners;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18125">6</sup> On
this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a feast of rich food for all peoples,<br>
a banquet of aged wine—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the best of meats and the finest of wines.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18126">7</sup> On this
mountain he will destroy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shroud that enfolds all peoples,<br>
the sheet that covers all nations;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18127">8</sup> he will
swallow up death forever.<br>
The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from all faces;<br>
he will remove the disgrace of his people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from all the earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
LORD has spoken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18128">9</sup> In
that day they will say,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Surely this is our God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we trusted in him, and he saved us.<br>
This is the LORD, we trusted in him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18129">10</sup> The
hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Moab will be trampled under him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as straw is trampled down in the manure.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18130">11</sup> They will
spread out their hands in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim.<br>
God will bring down their pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite the cleverness<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18130a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of their hands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18131">12</sup> He will bring
down your high fortified walls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay them low;<br>
he will bring them down to the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the very dust.</p>
