<h4>Isaiah 39</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Envoys From Babylon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18414">1</sup> At that
time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah
letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and
recovery. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18415">2</sup>
Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his
storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, his
entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was
nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not
show them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18416">3</sup> Then
Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those
men say, and where did they come from?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They
came to me from Babylon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18417">4</sup> The
prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah
said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show
them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18418">5</sup> Then
Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD Almighty:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18419">6</sup> The time will
surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your
fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to
Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-18420">7</sup> And some of your descendants, your
own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away,
and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of
Babylon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18421">8</sup> “The
word of the LORD you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he
thought, “There will be peace and security in my lifetime.”</p>
