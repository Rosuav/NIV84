<h4>Deuteronomy 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Ten Commandments</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5055">1</sup> Moses
summoned all Israel and said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I declare
in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5056">2</sup> The LORD our God
made a covenant with us at Horeb. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5057">3</sup> It was not with our fathers that the LORD
made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here
today. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5058">4</sup> The LORD
spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5059">5</sup> (At that time I
stood between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the
LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the
mountain.) And he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5060">6</sup> “I am
the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5061">7</sup> “You
shall have no other gods before<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5061a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5062">8</sup> “You
shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in
heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5063">9</sup> You shall not
bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a
jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to
the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5064">10</sup> but showing love to a
thousand generations of those who love me and keep my
commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5065">11</sup> “You
shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will
not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5066">12</sup>
“Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God
has commanded you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5067">13</sup> Six days you shall labor and do all your
work, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5068">14</sup> but the
seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not
do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your
manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your
animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant
and maidservant may rest, as you do. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5069">15</sup> Remember that you were slaves in Egypt
and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty
hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has
commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5070">16</sup> “Honor
your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded
you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in
the land the LORD your God is giving you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5071">17</sup> “You
shall not murder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5072">18</sup> “You
shall not commit adultery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5073">19</sup> “You
shall not steal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5074">20</sup> “You
shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5075">21</sup> “You
shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire
on your neighbor’s house or land, his manservant or maidservant,
his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5076">22</sup> These
are the commandments the LORD proclaimed in a loud voice to your
whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the
cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he
wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5077">23</sup> When
you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was
ablaze with fire, all the leading men of your tribes and your
elders came to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5078">24</sup> And you said, “The LORD our God has
shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice
from the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God
speaks with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5079">25</sup> But now, why should we die? This great
fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the
LORD our God any longer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5080">26</sup> For what mortal man has ever heard the
voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and
survived? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5081">27</sup> Go
near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us
whatever the LORD our God tells you. We will listen and obey.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5082">28</sup> The
LORD heard you when you spoke to me and the LORD said to me, “I
have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was
good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5083">29</sup> Oh, that
their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands
always, so that it might go well with them and their children
forever!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5084">30</sup> “Go,
tell them to return to their tents. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5085">31</sup> But you stay here with me so that I may
give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them
to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5086">32</sup> So be
careful to do what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn
aside to the right or to the left. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5087">33</sup> Walk in all the way that the LORD your
God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong
your days in the land that you will possess.</p>
