<h4>2 Samuel 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8358">1</sup> Joab son
of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8359">2</sup> So Joab sent
someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said
to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes,
and don’t use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent
many days grieving for the dead. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8360">3</sup> Then go to the king and speak these words
to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8361">4</sup> When
the woman from Tekoa went<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8361a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to the
king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and
she said, “Help me, O king!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8362">5</sup> The
king asked her, “What is troubling you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, “I am indeed a widow; my husband is
dead. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8363">6</sup> I your
servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the
field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other
and killed him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8364">7</sup>
Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say,
‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put
him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we
will get rid of the heir as well.’ They would put out the only
burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor
descendant on the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8365">8</sup> The
king said to the woman, “Go home, and I will issue an order in your
behalf.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8366">9</sup> But the
woman from Tekoa said to him, “My lord the king, let the blame rest
on me and on my father’s family, and let the king and his throne be
without guilt.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8367">10</sup> The
king replied, “If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and
he will not bother you again.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8368">11</sup> She
said, “Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the
avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son
will not be destroyed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As surely as the LORD lives,” he said, “not
one hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8369">12</sup> Then
the woman said, “Let your servant speak a word to my lord the
king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Speak,” he replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8370">13</sup> The
woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against
the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict
himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8371">14</sup> Like water
spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die.
But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a
banished person may not remain estranged from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8372">15</sup> “And
now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people
have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the
king; perhaps he will do what his servant asks. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8373">16</sup> Perhaps the king will
agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying
to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave
us.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8374">17</sup> “And
now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring me
rest, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning
good and evil. May the LORD your God be with you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8375">18</sup> Then
the king said to the woman, “Do not keep from me the answer to what
I am going to ask you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let my lord the king speak,” the woman
said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8376">19</sup> The
king asked, “Isn’t the hand of Joab with you in all this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my
lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from
anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who
instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth
of your servant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8377">20</sup> Your servant Joab did this to change the
present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of
God—he knows everything that happens in the land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8378">21</sup> The
king said to Joab, “Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the
young man Absalom.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8379">22</sup> Joab
fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed
the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that he has found
favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted
his servant’s request.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8380">23</sup> Then
Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8381">24</sup> But the king
said, “He must go to his own house; he must not see my face.” So
Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the
king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8382">25</sup> In all
Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome
appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his
foot there was no blemish in him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8383">26</sup> Whenever he cut the hair of his head—he
used to cut his hair from time to time when it became too heavy for
him—he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8383b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> by the royal standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8384">27</sup> Three
sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. The daughter’s name was
Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8385">28</sup>
Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king’s
face. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8386">29</sup> Then
Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab
refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to
come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8387">30</sup> Then he
said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he
has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set
the field on fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8388">31</sup> Then
Joab did go to Absalom’s house and he said to him, “Why have your
servants set my field on fire?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8389">32</sup>
Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come
here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from
Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!”’ Now
then, I want to see the king’s face, and if I am guilty of
anything, let him put me to death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8390">33</sup> So
Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned
Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground
before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</p>
