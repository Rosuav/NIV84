<h4>1 Samuel 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David and Jonathan</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7732">1</sup> Then David
fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What
have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that
he is trying to take my life?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7733">2</sup>
“Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my
father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without confiding in
me. Why would he hide this from me? It’s not so!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7734">3</sup> But
David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I
have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself,
‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely
as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me
and death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7735">4</sup>
Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for
you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7736">5</sup> So
David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am
supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field
until the evening of the day after tomorrow. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7737">6</sup> If your father misses me at all, tell
him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem,
his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for
his whole clan.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7738">7</sup>
If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses
his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7739">8</sup> As for you, show
kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant
with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself!
Why hand me over to your father?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7740">9</sup>
“Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father
was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7741">10</sup> David
asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7742">11</sup>
“Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went
there together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7743">12</sup> Then
Jonathan said to David: “By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will
surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If
he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and
let you know? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7744">13</sup>
But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with
me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you
away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my
father. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7745">14</sup> But
show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live,
so that I may not be killed, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7746">15</sup> and do not ever cut off your kindness
from my family—not even when the LORD has cut off every one of
David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7747">16</sup> So
Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the
LORD call David’s enemies to account.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7748">17</sup> And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath
out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7749">18</sup> Then
Jonathan said to David: “Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You
will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7750">19</sup> The day after tomorrow,
toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble
began, and wait by the stone Ezel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7751">20</sup> I will shoot three arrows to the side of
it, as though I were shooting at a target. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7752">21</sup> Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go,
find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this
side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the
LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7753">22</sup> But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the
arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the LORD has sent
you away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7754">23</sup> And
about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the LORD is witness
between you and me forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7755">24</sup> So
David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the
king sat down to eat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7756">25</sup> He sat in his customary place by the
wall, opposite Jonathan,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7756a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and
Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7757">26</sup> Saul said nothing that
day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make
him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7758">27</sup> But the next day, the
second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul
said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the
meal, either yesterday or today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7759">28</sup>
Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go
to Bethlehem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7760">29</sup>
He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in
the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found
favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is
why he has not come to the king’s table.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7761">30</sup> Saul’s
anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a
perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided
with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the
mother who bore you? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7762">31</sup> As long as the son of Jesse lives on
this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now
send and bring him to me, for he must die!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7763">32</sup> “Why
should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his
father. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7764">33</sup> But
Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that
his father intended to kill David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7765">34</sup>
Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day
of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s
shameful treatment of David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7766">35</sup> In the
morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David.
He had a small boy with him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7767">36</sup> and he said to the boy, “Run and find
the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7768">37</sup> When the boy
came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan
called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7769">38</sup> Then he shouted, “Hurry!
Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned
to his master. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7770">39</sup>
(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7771">40</sup> Then Jonathan
gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to
town.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7772">41</sup> After
the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and
bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the
ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David
wept the most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7773">42</sup>
Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship
with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD is
witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my
descendants forever.’” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to
the town.</p>
