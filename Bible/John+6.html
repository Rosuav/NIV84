<h4>John 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26248">1</sup> Some time
after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee
(that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26249">2</sup> and a great crowd of people followed him
because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26250">3</sup> Then Jesus went
up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26251">4</sup> The Jewish Passover Feast
was near.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26252">5</sup> When
Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to
Philip, <font class='woj'>“Where shall we buy bread for these
people to eat?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26253">6</sup> He asked this only to test him, for he
already had in mind what he was going to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26254">7</sup> Philip
answered him, “Eight months’ wages<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26254a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> would not
buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26255">8</sup>
Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26256">9</sup> “Here is a boy
with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will
they go among so many?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26257">10</sup> Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“Have the people sit down.”</font> There
was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five
thousand of them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26258">11</sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave
thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they
wanted. He did the same with the fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26259">12</sup> When
they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples,
<font class='woj'>“Gather the pieces that are left over. Let
nothing be wasted.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26260">13</sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve
baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by
those who had eaten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26261">14</sup> After
the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to
say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26262">15</sup> Jesus, knowing
that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew
again to a mountain by himself.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Walks on the Water</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26263">16</sup> When
evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26264">17</sup> where they got into a
boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark,
and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26265">18</sup> A strong wind was blowing and the
waters grew rough. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26266">19</sup> When they had rowed three or three and
a half miles,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26266b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> they saw Jesus approaching the
boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26267">20</sup> But he said to them,
<font class='woj'>“It is I; don’t be afraid.”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26268">21</sup> Then they were willing to
take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore
where they were heading.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26269">22</sup> The
next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the
lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had
not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away
alone. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26270">23</sup> Then
some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had
eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26271">24</sup> Once the crowd realized
that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the
boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus the Bread of Life</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26272">25</sup> When
they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him,
“Rabbi, when did you get here?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26273">26</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, you are looking
for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate
the loaves and had your fill.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26274">27</sup> Do not work for food that
spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of
Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of
approval.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26275">28</sup> Then
they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26276">29</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“The work of God is this: to believe in
the one he has sent.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26277">30</sup> So
they asked him, “What miraculous sign then will you give that we
may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26278">31</sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the
desert; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to
eat.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26278c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26279">32</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, it is not
Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father
who gives you the true bread from heaven.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26280">33</sup> For the
bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the
world.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26281">34</sup>
“Sir,” they said, “from now on give us this bread.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26282">35</sup> Then
Jesus declared, <font class='woj'>“I am the bread of life. He who
comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will
never be thirsty.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26283">36</sup> But as I told you, you have seen me
and still you do not believe.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26284">37</sup> All that the Father gives
me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive
away.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26285">38</sup> For I have come down from heaven not to
do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26286">39</sup> And this is the will of him who sent
me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise
them up at the last day.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26287">40</sup> For my Father’s will is
that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have
eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26288">41</sup> At
this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said,
<font class='woj'>“I am the bread that came down from
heaven.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26289">42</sup> They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son
of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say,
<font class='woj'>‘I came down from heaven’</font>?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26290">43</sup> “Stop grumbling among
yourselves,”</font> Jesus answered. <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26291">44</sup> “No one can come to me
unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at
the last day.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26292">45</sup> It is written in the Prophets: ‘They
will all be taught by God.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26292d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> Everyone
who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26293">46</sup> No one has seen the Father except the
one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26294">47</sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes
has everlasting life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26295">48</sup> I am the bread of
life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26296">49</sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the
desert, yet they died.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26297">50</sup> But here is the bread
that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not
die.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26298">51</sup> I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
world.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26299">52</sup> Then
the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26300">53</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, unless you
eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no
life in you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26301">54</sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last
day.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26302">55</sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood
is real drink.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26303">56</sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood remains in me, and I in him.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26304">57</sup> Just as
the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the
one who feeds on me will live because of me.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26305">58</sup> This is
the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna
and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26306">59</sup> He said this
while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Many Disciples Desert Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26307">60</sup> On
hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching.
Who can accept it?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26308">61</sup> Aware
that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them,
<font class='woj'>“Does this offend you?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26309">62</sup> What if
you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26310">63</sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts
for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26310e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and they are life.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26311">64</sup> Yet there are some of you who do not
believe.”</font> For Jesus had known from the beginning which of
them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26312">65</sup> He went on to say,
<font class='woj'>“This is why I told you that no one can come to
me unless the Father has enabled him.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26313">66</sup> From
this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26314">67</sup> “You do not want to leave too, do
you?”</font> Jesus asked the Twelve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26315">68</sup> Simon
Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words
of eternal life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26316">69</sup> We believe and know that you are the
Holy One of God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26317">70</sup> Then
Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“Have I not chosen you, the
Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”</font> <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26318">71</sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray
him.)</p>
