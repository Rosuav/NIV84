<h4>1 Chronicles 22</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10966">1</sup> Then
David said, “The house of the LORD God is to be here, and also the
altar of burnt offering for Israel.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Preparations for the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10967">2</sup> So David
gave orders to assemble the aliens living in Israel, and from among
them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for
building the house of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10968">3</sup> He provided a large amount of iron to
make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and
more bronze than could be weighed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10969">4</sup> He also provided more cedar logs than
could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large
numbers of them to David.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10970">5</sup> David
said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to
be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and
splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make
preparations for it.” So David made extensive preparations before
his death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10971">6</sup> Then
he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for
the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10972">7</sup> David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it
in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10973">8</sup> But this word
of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and have fought
many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you
have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10974">9</sup> But you will have a son
who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from
all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10974a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and I will grant Israel peace and
quiet during his reign. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10975">10</sup> He is the one who will build a house
for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I
will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10976">11</sup> “Now,
my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build
the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10977">12</sup> May the LORD give you
discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over
Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10978">13</sup> Then you will
have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws
that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do
not be afraid or discouraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10979">14</sup> “I
have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a
hundred thousand talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10979b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of
gold, a million talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10979c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of
silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and
wood and stone. And you may add to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10980">15</sup> You have many workmen: stonecutters,
masons and carpenters, as well as men skilled in every kind of work
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10981">16</sup> in gold and
silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the
work, and the LORD be with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10982">17</sup> Then
David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10983">18</sup> He said to
them, “Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted
you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the
land over to me, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his
people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10984">19</sup> Now
devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Begin to
build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark
of the covenant of the LORD and the sacred articles belonging to
God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the
LORD.”</p>
