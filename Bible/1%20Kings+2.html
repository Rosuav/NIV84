<h4>1 Kings 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David’s Charge to Solomon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8772">1</sup> When the
time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his
son.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8773">2</sup> “I am
about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, show
yourself a man, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8774">3</sup>
and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and
keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as
written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do
and wherever you go, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8775">4</sup> and that the LORD may keep his promise to
me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk
faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never
fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8776">5</sup> “Now
you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to
the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa
son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as
if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist
and the sandals on his feet. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8777">6</sup> Deal with him according to your wisdom,
but do not let his gray head go down to the grave<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8777a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8778">7</sup> “But
show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be
among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled
from your brother Absalom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8779">8</sup> “And
remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from
Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to
Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to
him by the LORD: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8780">9</sup> But now, do not
consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what
to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8781">10</sup> Then
David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8782">11</sup> He had reigned
forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8783">12</sup> So
Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was
firmly established.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Throne Established</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8784">13</sup> Now
Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother.
Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, “Yes, peacefully.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8785">14</sup> Then he added, “I have
something to say to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may say it,” she replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8786">15</sup> “As
you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me
as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my
brother; for it has come to him from the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8787">16</sup> Now I have one request to
make of you. Do not refuse me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may make it,” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8788">17</sup> So he
continued, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give
me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8789">18</sup> “Very
well,” Bathsheba replied, “I will speak to the king for you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8790">19</sup> When
Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the
king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his
throne. He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat
down at his right hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8791">20</sup> “I
have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse
me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will
not refuse you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8792">21</sup> So she
said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your
brother Adonijah.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8793">22</sup> King
Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the
Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for
him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar
the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8794">23</sup> Then
King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God deal with me, be it ever
so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this
request! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8795">24</sup> And
now, as surely as the LORD lives—he who has established me securely
on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me
as he promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today!” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8796">25</sup> So King Solomon gave
orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and
he died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8797">26</sup> To
Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in
Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now,
because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father
David and shared all my father’s hardships.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8798">27</sup> So Solomon removed Abiathar from the
priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at
Shiloh about the house of Eli.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8799">28</sup> When
the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not
with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the
horns of the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8800">29</sup> King Solomon was told that Joab had fled
to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon
ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8801">30</sup> So
Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king
says, ‘Come out!’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he answered, “No, I will die here.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how
Joab answered me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8802">31</sup> Then
the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and
bury him, and so clear me and my father’s house of the guilt of the
innocent blood that Joab shed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8803">32</sup> The LORD will repay him for the blood he
shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked
two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of
Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander
of Judah’s army—were better men and more upright than he.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8804">33</sup> May the guilt
of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants
forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his
throne, may there be the LORD’s peace forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8805">34</sup> So
Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed
him, and he was buried on his own land<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8805b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> in the desert. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8806">35</sup> The king put Benaiah son
of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar
with Zadok the priest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8807">36</sup> Then
the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house
in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8808">37</sup> The day you
leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die;
your blood will be on your own head.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8809">38</sup> Shimei
answered the king, “What you say is good. Your servant will do as
my lord the king has said.” And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a
long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8810">39</sup> But
three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran off to Achish son of
Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in
Gath.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8811">40</sup> At this,
he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his
slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from
Gath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8812">41</sup> When
Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and
had returned, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8813">42</sup>
the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear
by the LORD and warn you, ‘On the day you leave to go anywhere
else, you can be sure you will die’? At that time you said to me,
‘What you say is good. I will obey.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8814">43</sup> Why then did you not keep your oath to
the LORD and obey the command I gave you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8815">44</sup> The
king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wrong you
did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your
wrongdoing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8816">45</sup> But
King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain secure
before the LORD forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8817">46</sup> Then
the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out
and struck Shimei down and killed him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom was now firmly established in
Solomon’s hands.</p>
