<h4>Ezekiel 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">An Allegory of Unfaithful Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20764">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20765">2</sup> “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her
detestable practices <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20766">3</sup> and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign
LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of
the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a
Hittite. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20767">4</sup> On the
day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with
water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped
in cloths. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20768">5</sup> No
one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of
these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open
field, for on the day you were born you were despised.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20769">6</sup> “‘Then
I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay
there in your blood I said to you, “Live!”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20769a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20770">7</sup> I made you grow like a plant of the
field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of
jewels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20770b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Your breasts were formed and your
hair grew, you who were naked and bare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20771">8</sup>
“‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were
old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and
covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into
a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became
mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20772">9</sup> “‘I
bathed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20772c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> you with water and washed the blood
from you and put ointments on you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20773">10</sup> I clothed you with an embroidered dress
and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and
covered you with costly garments. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20774">11</sup> I adorned you with jewelry: I put
bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20775">12</sup> and I put a ring on your
nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20776">13</sup> So you were
adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and
costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour,
honey and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a
queen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20777">14</sup> And
your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty,
because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect,
declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20778">15</sup> “‘But
you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a
prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and
your beauty became his.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-20778d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20779">16</sup> You took some
of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on
your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they
ever occur. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20780">17</sup>
You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my
gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged
in prostitution with them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20781">18</sup> And you took your embroidered clothes
to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20782">19</sup> Also the food
I provided for you—the fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you
to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what
happened, declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20783">20</sup> “‘And
you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed
them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20784">21</sup> You
slaughtered my children and sacrificed them<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20784e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> to the idols. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-20785">22</sup> In all your detestable practices and
your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when
you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20786">23</sup>
“‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all
your other wickedness, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20787">24</sup> you built a mound for yourself and made
a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20788">25</sup> At the head of every street you built
your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, offering your body
with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20789">26</sup> You engaged in
prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and
provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20790">27</sup> So I stretched out my
hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the
greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were
shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20791">28</sup> You engaged in prostitution with the
Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that,
you still were not satisfied. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20792">29</sup> Then you increased your promiscuity to
include Babylonia,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-20792f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> a land of
merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20793">30</sup> “‘How
weak-willed you are, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all
these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20794">31</sup> When you built your
mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in
every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you
scorned payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20795">32</sup> “‘You
adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20796">33</sup> Every
prostitute receives a fee, but you give gifts to all your lovers,
bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit
favors. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20797">34</sup> So in
your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after
you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give
payment and none is given to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20798">35</sup>
“‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20799">36</sup> This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your wealth<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20799g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> and exposed your nakedness in your
promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable
idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20800">37</sup> therefore I am going to
gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you
loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you
from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will
see all your nakedness. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20801">38</sup> I will sentence you to the punishment
of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring upon
you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20802">39</sup> Then I will hand you over
to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy
your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take
your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20803">40</sup> They will bring a mob
against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their
swords. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20804">41</sup> They
will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the
sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and
you will no longer pay your lovers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20805">42</sup> Then my wrath against you will subside
and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no
longer angry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20806">43</sup>
“‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged
me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head
what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add
lewdness to all your other detestable practices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20807">44</sup>
“‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you:
“Like mother, like daughter.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20808">45</sup> You are a true daughter of your mother,
who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true
sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their
children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20809">46</sup> Your older
sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her
daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you
with her daughters, was Sodom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20810">47</sup> You not only walked in their ways and
copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon
became more depraved than they. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20811">48</sup> As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what
you and your daughters have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20812">49</sup> “‘Now
this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were
arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and
needy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20813">50</sup> They
were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did
away with them as you have seen. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20814">51</sup> Samaria did not commit half the sins
you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have
made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20815">52</sup> Bear your
disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your
sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear
more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your
disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20816">53</sup>
“‘However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters
and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with
them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20817">54</sup> so that
you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in
giving them comfort. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20818">55</sup> And your sisters, Sodom with her
daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they
were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you
were before. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20819">56</sup>
You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your
pride, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20820">57</sup> before
your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the
daughters of Edom<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-20820h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> and all
her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around
you who despise you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20821">58</sup> You will bear the consequences of your
lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20822">59</sup>
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you
deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the
covenant. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20823">60</sup> Yet
I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your
youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20824">61</sup> Then you will
remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters,
both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will
give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant
with you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20825">62</sup> So I
will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20826">63</sup>
Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will
remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of
your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”</p>
