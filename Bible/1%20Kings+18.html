<h5 class="passage-header">Elijah and Obadiah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9343">1</sup> After a
long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah:
“Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the
land.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9344">2</sup> So Elijah
went to present himself to Ahab.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the famine was severe in Samaria,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9345">3</sup> and Ahab had
summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a
devout believer in the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9346">4</sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD’s
prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in
two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and
water.) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9347">5</sup> Ahab had
said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and
valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules
alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9348">6</sup> So they divided the land
they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in
another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9349">7</sup> As
Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him,
bowed down to the ground, and said, “Is it really you, my lord
Elijah?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9350">8</sup> “Yes,”
he replied. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9351">9</sup> “What
have I done wrong,” asked Obadiah, “that you are handing your
servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9352">10</sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives,
there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent
someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed
you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9353">11</sup> But now you
tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9354">12</sup> I don’t know where the
Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell
Ahab and he doesn’t find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant
have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9355">13</sup> Haven’t you heard, my lord, what I did
while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred
of the LORD’s prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied
them with food and water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9356">14</sup> And now you tell me to go to my master
and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9357">15</sup> Elijah
said, “As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely
present myself to Ahab today.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Elijah on Mount Carmel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9358">16</sup> So
Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet
Elijah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9359">17</sup> When he
saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9360">18</sup> “I
have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and
your father’s family have. You have abandoned the LORD’s commands
and have followed the Baals. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9361">19</sup> Now summon the people from all over
Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and
fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah,
who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9362">20</sup> So
Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on
Mount Carmel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9363">21</sup>
Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver
between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal
is God, follow him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people said nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9364">22</sup> Then
Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the LORD’s prophets
left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9365">23</sup> Get two bulls for us. Let
them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and
put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other
bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9366">24</sup> Then you call on the name
of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who
answers by fire—he is God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the people said, “What you say is
good.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9367">25</sup> Elijah
said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare
it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your
god, but do not light the fire.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9368">26</sup> So they took the bull given them and
prepared it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they called on the name of Baal from
morning till noon. “O Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was
no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they
had made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9369">27</sup> At
noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely
he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling.
Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9370">28</sup> So they shouted louder and slashed
themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their
blood flowed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9371">29</sup>
Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until
the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no
one answered, no one paid attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9372">30</sup> Then
Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him,
and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9373">31</sup> Elijah took
twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to
whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Your name shall be
Israel.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9374">32</sup> With
the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a
trench around it large enough to hold two seahs<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9374a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of seed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9375">33</sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into
pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four
large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the
wood.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9376">34</sup> “Do it
again,” he said, and they did it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did
it the third time. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9377">35</sup> The water ran down around the altar and
even filled the trench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9378">36</sup> At the
time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed:
“O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today
that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done
all these things at your command. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9379">37</sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these
people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are
turning their hearts back again.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9380">38</sup> Then
the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood,
the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the
trench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9381">39</sup> When
all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The
LORD—he is God! The LORD—he is God!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9382">40</sup> Then
Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let
anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought
down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9383">41</sup> And
Elijah said to Ahab, “Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of
a heavy rain.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9384">42</sup>
So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of
Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his
knees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9385">43</sup> “Go
and look toward the sea,” he told his servant. And he went up and
looked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is nothing there,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9386">44</sup> The
seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s
hand is rising from the sea.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up
your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9387">45</sup>
Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy
rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9388">46</sup> The power of the LORD came upon
Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab
all the way to Jezreel.</p>
