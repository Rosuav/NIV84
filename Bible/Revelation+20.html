<h4>Revelation 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Thousand Years</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31024">1</sup> And I saw
an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and
holding in his hand a great chain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31025">2</sup> He seized the dragon, that ancient
serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31026">3</sup> He threw
him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him
from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were
ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31027">4</sup> I saw
thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to
judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because
of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They
had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his
mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and
reigned with Christ a thousand years. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31028">5</sup> (The rest of the dead did not come to
life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first
resurrection. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31029">6</sup>
Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection.
The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests
of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand
years.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Satan’s Doom</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31030">7</sup> When the
thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31031">8</sup> and will go out
to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and
Magog—to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand
on the seashore. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31032">9</sup> They marched across the breadth of the
earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves.
But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31033">10</sup> And the devil, who
deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where
the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be
tormented day and night for ever and ever.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Dead Are Judged</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31034">11</sup> Then I
saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and
sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31035">12</sup> And I saw the
dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The
dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the
books. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31036">13</sup> The sea
gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the
dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to
what he had done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31037">14</sup> Then death and Hades were thrown into
the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31038">15</sup> If anyone’s name was not
found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of
fire.</div>
