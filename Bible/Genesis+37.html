<h4>Genesis 37</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph’s Dreams</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1085">1</sup> Jacob
lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1086">2</sup> This is
the account of Jacob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending
the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of
Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad
report about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1087">3</sup> Now
Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had
been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly
ornamented<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1087a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> robe for him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1088">4</sup> When his brothers saw that
their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and
could not speak a kind word to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1089">5</sup> Joseph
had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him
all the more. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1090">6</sup> He
said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1091">7</sup> We were binding sheaves of grain out
in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while
your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1092">8</sup> His
brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you
actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his
dream and what he had said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1093">9</sup> Then he
had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he
said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and
eleven stars were bowing down to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1094">10</sup> When
he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him
and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and
your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1095">11</sup> His brothers
were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1096">12</sup> Now his
brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1097">13</sup> and Israel said
to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near
Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very well,” he replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1098">14</sup> So he
said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with
the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from
the Valley of Hebron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Joseph arrived at Shechem, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1099">15</sup> a man found him wandering
around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1100">16</sup> He
replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they
are grazing their flocks?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1101">17</sup> “They
have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say,
‘Let’s go to Dothan.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Joseph went after his brothers and found
them near Dothan. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1102">18</sup> But they saw him in the distance, and
before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1103">19</sup> “Here
comes that dreamer!” they said to each other. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1104">20</sup> “Come now, let’s kill him and throw
him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal
devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1105">21</sup> When
Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s
not take his life,” he said. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1106">22</sup> “Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into
this cistern here in the desert, but don’t lay a hand on him.”
Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his
father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1107">23</sup> So
when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the
richly ornamented robe he was wearing— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1108">24</sup> and they took him and threw him into the
cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1109">25</sup> As
they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan
of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with
spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them
down to Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1110">26</sup> Judah
said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and
cover up his blood? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1111">27</sup> Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites
and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own
flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1112">28</sup> So
when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up
out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1112b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of silver to the Ishmaelites, who
took him to Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1113">29</sup> When
Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there,
he tore his clothes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1114">30</sup> He went back to his brothers and said,
“The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1115">31</sup> Then
they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in
the blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1116">32</sup> They
took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, “We found
this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1117">33</sup> He
recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal
has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1118">34</sup> Then
Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son
many days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1119">35</sup> All
his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be
comforted. “No,” he said, “in mourning will I go down to the
grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1119c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to my son.” So his father wept for
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1120">36</sup>
Meanwhile, the Midianites<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1120d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> sold
Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the
captain of the guard.</p>
