<h4>1 Samuel 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Samuel Rebukes Saul</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7487">1</sup> Saul was
thirty<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7487a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> years old when he became king, and
he reigned over Israel forty-<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7487b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> two
years.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7488">2</sup>
Saul<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7488c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> chose three thousand men from
Israel; two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill
country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in
Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7489">3</sup>
Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the
Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown
throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7490">4</sup> So all Israel heard the
news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has
become a stench to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned
to join Saul at Gilgal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7491">5</sup> The
Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three
thousand<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7491d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> chariots, six thousand
charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7492">6</sup> When the men of Israel saw
that their situation was critical and that their army was hard
pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in
pits and cisterns. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7493">7</sup> Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to
the land of Gad and Gilead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops
with him were quaking with fear. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7494">8</sup> He waited seven days, the time set by
Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to
scatter. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7495">9</sup> So he
said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship
offerings.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7495e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>” And Saul offered up the
burnt offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7496">10</sup>
Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul
went out to greet him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7497">11</sup> “What
have you done?” asked Samuel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were
scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the
Philistines were assembling at Micmash, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7498">12</sup> I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will
come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD’s
favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7499">13</sup> “You
acted foolishly,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the
LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your
kingdom over Israel for all time. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7500">14</sup> But now your kingdom will not endure;
the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him
leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD’s
command.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7501">15</sup> Then
Samuel left Gilgal<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7501f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> and
went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were
with him. They numbered about six hundred.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel Without Weapons</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7502">16</sup> Saul and
his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in
Gibeah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7502g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> in Benjamin, while the Philistines
camped at Micmash. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7503">17</sup> Raiding parties went out from the
Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in
the vicinity of Shual, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7504">18</sup> another toward Beth Horon, and the third
toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the
desert.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7505">19</sup> Not a
blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the
Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or
spears!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7506">20</sup> So all
Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares,
mattocks, axes and sickles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7506h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup>
sharpened. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7507">21</sup> The
price was two thirds of a shekel<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-7507i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup> for
sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a
shekel<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7507j" title=
"Vea nota al pie j">j</a>]</sup> for sharpening forks and axes and
for repointing goads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7508">22</sup> So on
the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a
sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had
them.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jonathan Attacks the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7509">23</sup> Now a
detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
