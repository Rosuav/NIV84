<h4>Revelation 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Angel and the Little Scroll</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30847">1</sup> Then I
saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a
cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun,
and his legs were like fiery pillars. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30848">2</sup> He was holding a little scroll, which
lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his
left foot on the land, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30849">3</sup> and he gave a loud shout like the roar
of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30850">4</sup> And when the
seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice
from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do
not write it down.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30851">5</sup> Then
the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his
right hand to heaven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30852">6</sup> And he swore by him who lives for ever
and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the
earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and
said, “There will be no more delay! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30853">7</sup> But in the days when the seventh angel
is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be
accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the
prophets.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30854">8</sup> Then
the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go,
take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is
standing on the sea and on the land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30855">9</sup> So I
went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He
said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour,
but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30856">10</sup> I took the little scroll
from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my
mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30857">11</sup> Then I was told, “You
must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and
kings.”</p>
