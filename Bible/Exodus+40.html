<h4>Exodus 40</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Setting Up the Tabernacle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2709">1</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2710">2</sup> “Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of
Meeting, on the first day of the first month. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2711">3</sup> Place the ark of the Testimony in it
and shield the ark with the curtain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2712">4</sup> Bring in the table and set out what
belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2713">5</sup> Place the gold
altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the
curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2714">6</sup> “Place
the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the
tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2715">7</sup> place the basin between the Tent of
Meeting and the altar and put water in it. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2716">8</sup> Set up the courtyard around it and put
the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2717">9</sup> “Take
the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it;
consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2718">10</sup> Then anoint the
altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar,
and it will be most holy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2719">11</sup> Anoint the basin and its stand and
consecrate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2720">12</sup> “Bring
Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash
them with water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2721">13</sup> Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments,
anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2722">14</sup> Bring his sons
and dress them in tunics. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2723">15</sup> Anoint them just as you anointed their
father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to
a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2724">16</sup> Moses did
everything just as the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2725">17</sup> So the
tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the
second year. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2726">18</sup>
When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place,
erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2727">19</sup> Then he spread
the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as
the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2728">20</sup> He
took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to
the ark and put the atonement cover over it. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2729">21</sup> Then he brought the ark into the
tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of
the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2730">22</sup> Moses
placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the
tabernacle outside the curtain <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2731">23</sup> and set out the bread on it before the
LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2732">24</sup> He
placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on
the south side of the tabernacle <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2733">25</sup> and set up the lamps before the LORD, as
the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2734">26</sup> Moses
placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the
curtain <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2735">27</sup> and
burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2736">28</sup> Then he put up
the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2737">29</sup> He set
the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle,
the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain
offerings, as the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2738">30</sup> He
placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put
water in it for washing, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2739">31</sup> and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it
to wash their hands and feet. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2740">32</sup> They washed whenever they entered the
Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2741">33</sup> Then
Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put
up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses
finished the work.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Glory of the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2742">34</sup> Then the
cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled
the tabernacle. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2743">35</sup>
Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had
settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2744">36</sup> In all
the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above
the tabernacle, they would set out; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2745">37</sup> but if the cloud did not lift, they did
not set out—until the day it lifted. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2746">38</sup> So the cloud of the LORD was over the
tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight
of all the house of Israel during all their travels.</p>
