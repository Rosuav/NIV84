<h4>Ezekiel 42</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Rooms for the Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21554">1</sup> Then the
man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the
rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on
the north side. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21555">2</sup>
The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21555a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> long and fifty cubits wide.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21556">3</sup> Both in the
section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section
opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at
the three levels. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21557">4</sup> In front of the rooms was an inner
passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21557b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> long. Their doors were on the north.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21558">5</sup> Now the upper
rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them
than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21559">6</sup> The rooms on
the third floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were
smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21560">7</sup> There was an
outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended
in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21561">8</sup> While the row of rooms on the side next
to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side
nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21562">9</sup> The lower rooms had an
entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21563">10</sup> On
the south side<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21563c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> along the length of the wall of
the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the
outer wall, were rooms <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21564">11</sup> with a passageway in front of them.
These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length
and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the
doorways on the north <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21565">12</sup> were the doorways of the rooms on the
south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that
was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which
one enters the rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21566">13</sup> Then
he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple
courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach
the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the
most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the
guilt offerings—for the place is holy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21567">14</sup> Once the priests enter the holy
precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave
behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy.
They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places
that are for the people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21568">15</sup> When
he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led
me out by the east gate and measured the area all around:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21569">16</sup> He measured
the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred
cubits.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21569d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21570">17</sup> He measured the north side; it was five
hundred cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21570e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> by the measuring rod.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21571">18</sup> He measured
the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21572">19</sup> Then he turned
to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the
measuring rod. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21573">20</sup>
So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it,
five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate
the holy from the common.</p>
