<h4>1 Corinthians 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Rights of an Apostle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28526">1</sup> Am I not
free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you
not the result of my work in the Lord? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28527">2</sup> Even though I may not be an apostle to
others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship
in the Lord.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28528">3</sup> This
is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28529">4</sup> Don’t we have the right to
food and drink? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28530">5</sup>
Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as
do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28530a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28531">6</sup> Or is it only I and Barnabas who must
work for a living?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28532">7</sup> Who
serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of
the milk? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28533">8</sup> Do I
say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn’t the Law say the
same thing? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28534">9</sup> For
it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is
treading out the grain.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28534b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Is it
about oxen that God is concerned? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28535">10</sup> Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he?
Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and
the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing
in the harvest. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28536">11</sup> If we have sown spiritual seed among
you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28537">12</sup> If others have
this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the
more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we did not use this right. On the
contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of
Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28538">13</sup> Don’t
you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the
temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered
on the altar? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28539">14</sup>
In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the
gospel should receive their living from the gospel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28540">15</sup> But I
have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the
hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than
have anyone deprive me of this boast. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28541">16</sup> Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot
boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach
the gospel! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28542">17</sup> If
I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am
simply discharging the trust committed to me. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28543">18</sup> What then is my reward? Just this:
that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so
not make use of my rights in preaching it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28544">19</sup>
Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to
everyone, to win as many as possible. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28545">20</sup> To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win
the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law
(though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under
the law. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28546">21</sup> To
those not having the law I became like one not having the law
(though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so
as to win those not having the law. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28547">22</sup> To the weak I became weak, to win the
weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible
means I might save some. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28548">23</sup> I do all this for the sake of the
gospel, that I may share in its blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28549">24</sup> Do
you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets
the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28550">25</sup> Everyone who competes in
the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that
will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28551">26</sup> Therefore I do
not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man
beating the air. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28552">27</sup> No, I beat my body and make it my slave
so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be
disqualified for the prize.</p>
