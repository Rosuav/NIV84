<h4>Exodus 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plague on the Firstborn</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1808">1</sup> Now the
LORD had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh
and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he
does, he will drive you out completely. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1809">2</sup> Tell the people that men and women alike
are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1810">3</sup> (The LORD made
the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses
himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by
the people.)
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1811">4</sup> So
Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go
throughout Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1812">5</sup> Every firstborn son in Egypt will die,
from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the
firstborn son of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all
the firstborn of the cattle as well. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1813">6</sup> There will be loud wailing throughout
Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1814">7</sup> But among the
Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.’ Then you will
know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1815">8</sup> All these
officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and
saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I
will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1816">9</sup> The
LORD had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so
that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1817">10</sup> Moses and Aaron performed all these
wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and
he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</p>
