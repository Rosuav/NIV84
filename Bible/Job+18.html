<h5 class="passage-header">Bildad</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13278">1</sup> Then
Bildad the Shuhite replied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13279">2</sup> “When
will you end these speeches?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sensible, and then we can talk.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13280">3</sup> Why are we
regarded as cattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and considered stupid in your sight?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13281">4</sup> You who tear
yourself to pieces in your anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the earth to be abandoned for your sake?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13282">5</sup> “The
lamp of the wicked is snuffed out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flame of his fire stops burning.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13283">6</sup> The light in
his tent becomes dark;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lamp beside him goes out.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13284">7</sup> The vigor of
his step is weakened;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own schemes throw him down.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13285">8</sup> His feet thrust
him into a net<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he wanders into its mesh.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13286">9</sup> A trap seizes
him by the heel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a snare holds him fast.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13287">10</sup> A noose is
hidden for him on the ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a trap lies in his path.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13288">11</sup> Terrors
startle him on every side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dog his every step.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13289">12</sup> Calamity is
hungry for him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disaster is ready for him when he falls.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13290">13</sup> It eats away
parts of his skin;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death’s firstborn devours his limbs.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13291">14</sup> He is torn
from the security of his tent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and marched off to the king of terrors.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13292">15</sup> Fire
resides<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13292a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in his tent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning sulfur is scattered over his
dwelling.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13293">16</sup> His roots dry
up below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his branches wither above.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13294">17</sup> The memory of
him perishes from the earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has no name in the land.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13295">18</sup> He is driven
from light into darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is banished from the world.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13296">19</sup> He has no
offspring or descendants among his people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no survivor where once he lived.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13297">20</sup> Men of the
west are appalled at his fate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of the east are seized with horror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13298">21</sup> Surely such is
the dwelling of an evil man;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such is the place of one who knows not God.”</p>
