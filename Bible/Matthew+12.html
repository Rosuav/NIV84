<h4>Matthew 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Lord of the Sabbath</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23491">1</sup> At that
time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His
disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23492">2</sup> When the
Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are
doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23493">3</sup> He
answered, <font class='woj'>“Haven’t you read what David did when
he and his companions were hungry?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23494">4</sup> He
entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the
consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for
the priests.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23495">5</sup> Or haven’t you read in the Law that on
the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are
innocent?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23496">6</sup> I tell you that one<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23496a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> greater than the temple is
here.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23497">7</sup> If you had known what these words mean,
‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23497b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> you would
not have condemned the innocent.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23498">8</sup> For the
Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23499">9</sup> Going
on from that place, he went into their synagogue, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23500">10</sup> and a man with a
shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus,
they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23501">11</sup> He
said to them, <font class='woj'>“If any of you has a sheep and it
falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and
lift it out?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23502">12</sup> How much more valuable is a man than a
sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the
Sabbath.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23503">13</sup> Then
he said to the man, <font class='woj'>“Stretch out your
hand.”</font> So he stretched it out and it was completely
restored, just as sound as the other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23504">14</sup> But the Pharisees went out and plotted
how they might kill Jesus.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Chosen Servant</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23505">15</sup> Aware of
this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he
healed all their sick, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23506">16</sup> warning them not to tell who he was.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23507">17</sup> This was to
fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23508">18</sup> “Here
is my servant whom I have chosen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one I love, in whom I delight;<br>
I will put my Spirit on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will proclaim justice to the nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23509">19</sup> He will not
quarrel or cry out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will hear his voice in the streets.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23510">20</sup> A bruised reed
he will not break,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,<br>
till he leads justice to victory.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23511">21</sup> In his
name the nations will put their hope.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23511c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus and Beelzebub</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23512">22</sup> Then
they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and
Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23513">23</sup> All the people were
astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23514">24</sup> But
when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by
Beelzebub,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23514d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the prince of demons, that this
fellow drives out demons.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23515">25</sup> Jesus
knew their thoughts and said to them, <font class='woj'>“Every
kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or
household divided against itself will not stand.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23516">26</sup> If Satan drives out Satan, he is
divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23517">27</sup> And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub,
by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your
judges.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23518">28</sup> But if I drive out demons by the Spirit
of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23519">29</sup> “Or again, how can anyone enter a
strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first
ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23520">30</sup> “He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me scatters.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23521">31</sup> And so I
tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the
blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23522">32</sup> Anyone who speaks a word against the
Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to
come.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23523">33</sup> “Make a tree good and its fruit will be
good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is
recognized by its fruit.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23524">34</sup> You brood of vipers, how
can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of
the heart the mouth speaks.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23525">35</sup> The good man brings good
things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings
evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23526">36</sup> But I
tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment
for every careless word they have spoken.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23527">37</sup> For by
your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be
condemned.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Sign of Jonah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23528">38</sup> Then
some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him,
“Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23529">39</sup> He
answered, <font class='woj'>“A wicked and adulterous generation
asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the
sign of the prophet Jonah.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23530">40</sup> For as Jonah was three
days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of
Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23531">41</sup> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the
judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at
the preaching of Jonah, and now one<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23531e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> greater
than Jonah is here.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23532">42</sup> The Queen of the South will rise at
the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from
the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now one
greater than Solomon is here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23533">43</sup> “When an evil<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23533f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> spirit comes out of a man, it goes
through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23534">44</sup> Then it says, ‘I will return to the
house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied,
swept clean and put in order.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23535">45</sup> Then it goes and takes
with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in
and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than
the first. That is how it will be with this wicked
generation.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23536">46</sup> While
Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood
outside, wanting to speak to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23537">47</sup> Someone told him, “Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23537g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23538">48</sup> He
replied to him, <font class='woj'>“Who is my mother, and who are my
brothers?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23539">49</sup> Pointing to his disciples, he said,
<font class='woj'>“Here are my mother and my brothers.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23540">50</sup> For whoever does the will of my Father
in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</font></p>
