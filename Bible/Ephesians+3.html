<h4>Ephesians 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul the Preacher to the Gentiles</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29237">1</sup> For this
reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you
Gentiles—
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29238">2</sup> Surely
you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was
given to me for you, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29239">3</sup> that is, the mystery made known to me by
revelation, as I have already written briefly. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29240">4</sup> In reading this, then, you
will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29241">5</sup> which was not
made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed
by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29242">6</sup> This mystery is that
through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel,
members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise
in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29243">7</sup> I
became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me
through the working of his power. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29244">8</sup> Although I am less than the least of all
God’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles
the unsearchable riches of Christ, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29245">9</sup> and to make plain to everyone the
administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden
in God, who created all things. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29246">10</sup> His intent was that now, through the
church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the
rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29247">11</sup> according to his eternal
purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29248">12</sup> In him and through faith
in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29249">13</sup> I ask you, therefore, not
to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your
glory.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prayer for the Ephesians</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29250">14</sup> For this
reason I kneel before the Father, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29251">15</sup> from whom his whole family<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29251a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in heaven and on earth derives its
name. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29252">16</sup> I pray
that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power
through his Spirit in your inner being, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29253">17</sup> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in
love, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29254">18</sup> may have
power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and
high and deep is the love of Christ, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29255">19</sup> and to know this love that surpasses
knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness
of God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29256">20</sup> Now
to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or
imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29257">21</sup> to him be
glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
