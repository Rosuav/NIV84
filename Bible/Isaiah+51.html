<h4>Isaiah 51</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Everlasting Salvation for Zion</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18675">1</sup> “Listen
to me, you who pursue righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who seek the LORD:<br>
Look to the rock from which you were cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the quarry from which you were hewn;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18676">2</sup> look to
Abraham, your father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to Sarah, who gave you birth.<br>
When I called him he was but one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I blessed him and made him many.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18677">3</sup> The LORD will
surely comfort Zion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will look with compassion on all her
ruins;<br>
he will make her deserts like Eden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her wastelands like the garden of the LORD.<br>
Joy and gladness will be found in her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanksgiving and the sound of singing.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18678">4</sup>
“Listen to me, my people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear me, my nation:<br>
The law will go out from me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my justice will become a light to the
nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18679">5</sup> My
righteousness draws near speedily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my salvation is on the way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my arm will bring justice to the nations.<br>
The islands will look to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wait in hope for my arm.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18680">6</sup> Lift up your
eyes to the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look at the earth beneath;<br>
the heavens will vanish like smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth will wear out like a garment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its inhabitants die like flies.<br>
But my salvation will last forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my righteousness will never fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18681">7</sup> “Hear
me, you who know what is right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you people who have my law in your hearts:<br>
Do not fear the reproach of men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or be terrified by their insults.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18682">8</sup> For the moth
will eat them up like a garment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the worm will devour them like wool.<br>
But my righteousness will last forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my salvation through all generations.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18683">9</sup> Awake,
awake! Clothe yourself with strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O arm of the LORD;<br>
awake, as in days gone by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in generations of old.<br>
Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who pierced that monster through?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18684">10</sup> Was it not you
who dried up the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the waters of the great deep,<br>
who made a road in the depths of the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the redeemed might cross over?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18685">11</sup> The ransomed
of the LORD will return.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will enter Zion with singing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everlasting joy will crown their heads.<br>
Gladness and joy will overtake them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sorrow and sighing will flee away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18686">12</sup> “I,
even I, am he who comforts you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are you that you fear mortal men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of men, who are but grass,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18687">13</sup> that you
forget the LORD your Maker,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who stretched out the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laid the foundations of the earth,<br>
that you live in constant terror every day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the wrath of the oppressor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is bent on destruction?<br>
For where is the wrath of the oppressor?<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18688">14</sup> The
cowering prisoners will soon be set free;<br>
they will not die in their dungeon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will they lack bread.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18689">15</sup> For I am the
LORD your God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who churns up the sea so that its waves roar—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty is his name.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18690">16</sup> I have put my
words in your mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and covered you with the shadow of my hand—<br>
I who set the heavens in place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who laid the foundations of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Cup of the LORD’s Wrath</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18691">17</sup> Awake,
awake!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up, O Jerusalem,<br>
you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cup of his wrath,<br>
you who have drained to its dregs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the goblet that makes men stagger.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18692">18</sup> Of all the
sons she bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was none to guide her;<br>
of all the sons she reared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was none to take her by the hand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18693">19</sup> These double
calamities have come upon you—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can comfort you?—<br>
ruin and destruction, famine and sword—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18693a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
console you?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18694">20</sup> Your sons have
fainted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they lie at the head of every street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like antelope caught in a net.<br>
They are filled with the wrath of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rebuke of your God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18695">21</sup>
Therefore hear this, you afflicted one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made drunk, but not with wine.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18696">22</sup> This is what
your Sovereign LORD says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your God, who defends his people:<br>
“See, I have taken out of your hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cup that made you stagger;<br>
from that cup, the goblet of my wrath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will never drink again.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18697">23</sup> I will put it
into the hands of your tormentors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who said to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Fall prostrate that we may walk over you.’<br>
And you made your back like the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a street to be walked over.”</p>
