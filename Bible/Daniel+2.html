<h4>Daniel 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21760">1</sup> In the
second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was
troubled and he could not sleep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21761">2</sup> So the king summoned the magicians,
enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21761a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> to tell him what he had dreamed. When
they came in and stood before the king, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21762">3</sup> he said to them, “I have had a dream
that troubles me and I want to know what it means.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21762b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21763">4</sup> Then
the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21763c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> “O king, live forever! Tell your
servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21764">5</sup> The
king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly
decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it,
I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles
of rubble. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21765">6</sup> But
if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me
gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and
interpret it for me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21766">7</sup> Once
more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and
we will interpret it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21767">8</sup> Then
the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time,
because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21768">9</sup> If you do not
tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have
conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the
situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know
that you can interpret it for me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21769">10</sup> The
astrologers answered the king, “There is not a man on earth who can
do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever
asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21770">11</sup> What the king
asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the
gods, and they do not live among men.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21771">12</sup> This
made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of
all the wise men of Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21772">13</sup> So the decree was issued to put the
wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his
friends to put them to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21773">14</sup> When
Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to
death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and
tact. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21774">15</sup> He asked
the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?”
Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21775">16</sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king
and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21776">17</sup> Then
Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his
friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21777">18</sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from
the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his
friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of
Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21778">19</sup>
During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision.
Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21779">20</sup> and said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise be to the name of God for ever and
ever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom and power are his.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21780">21</sup> He changes
times and seasons;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sets up kings and deposes them.<br>
He gives wisdom to the wise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowledge to the discerning.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21781">22</sup> He reveals
deep and hidden things;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he knows what lies in darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and light dwells with him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21782">23</sup> I thank and
praise you, O God of my fathers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have given me wisdom and power,<br>
you have made known to me what we asked of you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have made known to us the dream of the
king.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Daniel Interprets the Dream</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21783">24</sup> Then
Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the
wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men
of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for
him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21784">25</sup>
Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a
man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his
dream means.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21785">26</sup> The
king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell
me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21786">27</sup>
Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can
explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21787">28</sup> but there is a God in
heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what
will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed
through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21788">29</sup> “As
you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come,
and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21789">30</sup> As for me,
this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater
wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the
interpretation and that you may understand what went through your
mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21790">31</sup> “You
looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue—an
enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21791">32</sup> The head of the statue
was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and
thighs of bronze, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21792">33</sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of
iron and partly of baked clay. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21793">34</sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut
out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of
iron and clay and smashed them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21794">35</sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze,
the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and
became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind
swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck
the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21795">36</sup> “This
was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21796">37</sup> You, O king,
are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and
power and might and glory; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21797">38</sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and
the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they
live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of
gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21798">39</sup>
“After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a
third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21799">40</sup> Finally, there
will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and
smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will
crush and break all the others. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21800">41</sup> Just as you saw that the feet and toes
were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a
divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in
it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21801">42</sup> As the toes were partly iron and partly
clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21802">43</sup> And just as
you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a
mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with
clay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21803">44</sup> “In
the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another
people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end,
but it will itself endure forever. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21804">45</sup> This is the meaning of the vision of
the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that
broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to
pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The great God has shown the king what will
take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation
is trustworthy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21805">46</sup> Then
King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor
and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21806">47</sup> The king said
to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of
kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this
mystery.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21807">48</sup> Then
the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts
on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and
placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21808">49</sup> Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king
appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the
province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal
court.</p>
