<h4>Exodus 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Birth of Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1556">1</sup> Now a man
of the house of Levi married a Levite woman, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1557">2</sup> and she became pregnant and gave birth
to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for
three months. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1558">3</sup>
But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for
him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in
it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1559">4</sup> His sister stood
at a distance to see what would happen to him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1560">5</sup> Then
Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her
attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket
among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1561">6</sup> She opened it and saw the
baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of
the Hebrew babies,” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1562">7</sup> Then
his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the
Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1563">8</sup> “Yes,
go,” she answered. And the girl went and got the baby’s mother.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1564">9</sup> Pharaoh’s
daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I
will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1565">10</sup> When the child
grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her
son. She named him Moses,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1565a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> saying,
“I drew him out of the water.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Moses Flees to Midian</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1566">11</sup> One day,
after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were
and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a
Hebrew, one of his own people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1567">12</sup> Glancing this way and that and seeing no
one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1568">13</sup> The next day he went out
and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why
are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1569">14</sup> The
man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking
of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid
and thought, “What I did must have become known.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1570">15</sup> When
Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from
Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1571">16</sup> Now a priest of
Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill
the troughs to water their father’s flock. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1572">17</sup> Some shepherds came along and drove
them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered
their flock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1573">18</sup> When
the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have
you returned so early today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1574">19</sup> They
answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew
water for us and watered the flock.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1575">20</sup> “And
where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him?
Invite him to have something to eat.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1576">21</sup> Moses
agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to
Moses in marriage. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1577">22</sup> Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses
named him Gershom,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1577b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> saying,
“I have become an alien in a foreign land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1578">23</sup> During
that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in
their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of
their slavery went up to God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1579">24</sup> God heard their groaning and he
remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1580">25</sup> So God looked
on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</p>
