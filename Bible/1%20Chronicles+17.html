<h4>1 Chronicles 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Promise to David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10865">1</sup> After
David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet,
“Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of the
covenant of the LORD is under a tent.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10866">2</sup> Nathan
replied to David, “Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is
with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10867">3</sup> That
night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10868">4</sup> “Go
and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: You are not
the one to build me a house to dwell in. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10869">5</sup> I have not dwelt in a house from the day
I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one
tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10870">6</sup> Wherever I have
moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their
leaders<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10870a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> whom I commanded to shepherd my
people, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10871">7</sup> “Now
then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says:
I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be
ruler over my people Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10872">8</sup> I have been with you wherever you have
gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I
will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the
earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10873">9</sup> And I
will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so
that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed.
Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the
beginning <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10874">10</sup> and
have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people
Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I declare to you that the LORD will build a
house for you: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10875">11</sup>
When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will
raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I
will establish his kingdom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10876">12</sup> He is the one who will build a house
for me, and I will establish his throne forever. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10877">13</sup> I will be his father, and
he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I
took it away from your predecessor. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10878">14</sup> I will set him over my house and my
kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10879">15</sup>
Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire
revelation.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David’s Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10880">16</sup> Then
King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family,
that you have brought me this far? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10881">17</sup> And as if this were not enough in your
sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your
servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of
men, O LORD God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10882">18</sup> “What
more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know
your servant, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10883">19</sup>
O LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will,
you have done this great thing and made known all these great
promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10884">20</sup>
“There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God but you, as
we have heard with our own ears. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10885">21</sup> And who is like your people Israel—the
one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for
himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and
awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people,
whom you redeemed from Egypt? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10886">22</sup> You made your people Israel your very
own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10887">23</sup> “And
now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant
and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10888">24</sup> so that it
will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then
men will say, ‘The LORD Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel’s
God!’ And the house of your servant David will be established
before you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10889">25</sup> “You,
my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house
for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10890">26</sup> O LORD, you
are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10891">27</sup> Now you have
been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may
continue forever in your sight; for you, O LORD, have blessed it,
and it will be blessed forever.”</p>
