<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Abraham</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-660">1</sup> Abraham
took<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-660a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> another wife, whose name was
Keturah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-661">2</sup> She bore
him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-662">3</sup> Jokshan was the father of
Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the
Letushites and the Leummites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-663">4</sup> The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher,
Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-664">5</sup> Abraham
left everything he owned to Isaac. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-665">6</sup> But while he was still living, he gave
gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son
Isaac to the land of the east.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-666">7</sup>
Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-667">8</sup> Then Abraham
breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full
of years; and he was gathered to his people. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-668">9</sup> His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him
in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of
Zohar the Hittite, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-669">10</sup> the field Abraham had bought from the
Hittites.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-669b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> There Abraham was buried with his
wife Sarah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-670">11</sup>
After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived
near Beer Lahai Roi.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ishmael’s Sons</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-671">12</sup> This is
the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s maidservant,
Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-672">13</sup> These
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their
birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-673">14</sup> Mishma, Dumah,
Massa, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-674">15</sup> Hadad,
Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-675">16</sup> These were the sons of Ishmael, and these
are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their
settlements and camps. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-676">17</sup> Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and
thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was
gathered to his people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-677">18</sup> His descendants settled in the area from
Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur.
And they lived in hostility toward<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-677c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> all
their brothers.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob and Esau</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-678">19</sup> This is
the account of Abraham’s son Isaac.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham became the father of Isaac,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-679">20</sup> and Isaac was
forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the
Aramean from Paddan Aram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-679d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and
sister of Laban the Aramean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-680">21</sup> Isaac
prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren.
The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-681">22</sup> The babies
jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening
to me?” So she went to inquire of the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-682">23</sup> The
LORD said to her,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Two nations are in your womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two peoples from within you will be
separated;<br>
one people will be stronger than the other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the older will serve the younger.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-683">24</sup> When
the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her
womb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-684">25</sup> The first
to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment;
so they named him Esau.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-684e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-685">26</sup> After this, his
brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was
named Jacob.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-685f"
title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> Isaac was sixty years old
when Rebekah gave birth to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-686">27</sup> The
boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open
country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-687">28</sup> Isaac, who had a
taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-688">29</sup> Once
when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open
country, famished. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-689">30</sup> He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have
some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also
called Edom.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-689g"
title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-690">31</sup> Jacob
replied, “First sell me your birthright.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-691">32</sup> “Look,
I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to
me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-692">33</sup> But
Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him,
selling his birthright to Jacob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-693">34</sup> Then
Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank,
and then got up and left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Esau despised his birthright.</p>
