<h4>Exodus 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Bricks Without Straw</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1634">1</sup> Afterward
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD,
the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a
festival to me in the desert.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1635">2</sup> Pharaoh
said, “Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I
do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1636">3</sup> Then
they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take
a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD
our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1637">4</sup> But the
king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people
away from their labor? Get back to your work!” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1638">5</sup> Then Pharaoh said, “Look,
the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them
from working.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1639">6</sup> That
same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen
in charge of the people: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1640">7</sup> “You are no longer to supply the people
with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own
straw. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1641">8</sup> But
require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t
reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out,
‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1642">9</sup> Make the work harder for the men so that
they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1643">10</sup> Then
the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people,
“This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1644">11</sup> Go and get your
own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be
reduced at all.’” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1645">12</sup> So the people scattered all over Egypt
to gather stubble to use for straw. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1646">13</sup> The slave drivers kept pressing them,
saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as
when you had straw.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1647">14</sup> The Israelite foremen appointed by
Pharaoh’s slave drivers were beaten and were asked, “Why didn’t you
meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1648">15</sup> Then
the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you
treated your servants this way? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1649">16</sup> Your servants are given no straw, yet we
are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the
fault is with your own people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1650">17</sup>
Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep
saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1651">18</sup> Now get to work. You will
not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of
bricks.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1652">19</sup> The
Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were
told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you
for each day.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1653">20</sup>
When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet
them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1654">21</sup> and they
said, “May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a
stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their
hand to kill us.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">God Promises Deliverance</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1655">22</sup> Moses
returned to the LORD and said, “O Lord, why have you brought
trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1656">23</sup> Ever since I went to
Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this
people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”</div>
