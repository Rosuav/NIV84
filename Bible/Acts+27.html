<h4>Acts 27</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul Sails for Rome</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27843">1</sup> When it
was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other
prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who
belonged to the Imperial Regiment. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27844">2</sup> We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about
to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we
put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was
with us.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27845">3</sup> The
next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul,
allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his
needs. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27846">4</sup> From
there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus
because the winds were against us. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27847">5</sup> When we had sailed across the open sea
off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27848">6</sup> There the
centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on
board. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27849">7</sup> We made
slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus.
When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the
lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27850">8</sup> We moved along the coast with difficulty
and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27851">9</sup> Much
time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous
because by now it was after the Fast.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27851a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> So Paul warned them, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27852">10</sup> “Men, I can see that our
voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and
cargo, and to our own lives also.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27853">11</sup> But the centurion, instead of listening
to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the
owner of the ship. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27854">12</sup> Since the harbor was unsuitable to
winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to
reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing
both southwest and northwest.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Storm</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27855">13</sup> When a
gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained
what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore
of Crete. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27856">14</sup>
Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the
“northeaster,” swept down from the island. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27857">15</sup> The ship was caught by the storm and
could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven
along. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27858">16</sup> As we
passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly
able to make the lifeboat secure. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27859">17</sup> When the men had hoisted it aboard,
they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together.
Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they
lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27860">18</sup> We took such a
violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to
throw the cargo overboard. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27861">19</sup> On the third day, they threw the ship’s
tackle overboard with their own hands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27862">20</sup> When neither sun nor stars appeared for
many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all
hope of being saved.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27863">21</sup> After
the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before
them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail
from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and
loss. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27864">22</sup> But now
I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be
lost; only the ship will be destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27865">23</sup> Last night an angel of the God whose I
am and whom I serve stood beside me <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27866">24</sup> and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You
must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you
the lives of all who sail with you.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27867">25</sup> So keep up your courage, men, for I
have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27868">26</sup> Nevertheless,
we must run aground on some island.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Shipwreck</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27869">27</sup> On the
fourteenth night we were still being driven across the
Adriatic<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27869b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Sea, when about midnight the sailors
sensed they were approaching land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27870">28</sup> They took soundings and found that the
water was a hundred and twenty feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27870c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> deep. A
short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety
feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27870d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> deep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27871">29</sup> Fearing that we would be dashed against
the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for
daylight. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27872">30</sup> In
an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat
down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors
from the bow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27873">31</sup>
Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men
stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27874">32</sup> So the soldiers cut the ropes that held
the lifeboat and let it fall away.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27875">33</sup> Just
before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen
days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone
without food—you haven’t eaten anything. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27876">34</sup> Now I urge you to take some food. You
need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his
head.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27877">35</sup> After
he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of
them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27878">36</sup> They were all encouraged and ate
some food themselves. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27879">37</sup> Altogether there were 276 of us on
board. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27880">38</sup> When
they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by
throwing the grain into the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27881">39</sup> When
daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay
with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if
they could. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27882">40</sup>
Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the
same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted
the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27883">41</sup> But the ship struck a
sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and
the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27884">42</sup> The
soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from
swimming away and escaping. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27885">43</sup> But the centurion wanted to spare
Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered
those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27886">44</sup> The rest were
to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way
everyone reached land in safety.</p>
