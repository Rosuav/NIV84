<h4>Esther 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The King’s Edict in Behalf of the
Jews</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12819">1</sup> That same
day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of
the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for
Esther had told how he was related to her. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12820">2</sup> The king took off his signet ring,
which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai.
And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12821">3</sup> Esther
again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She
begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite,
which he had devised against the Jews. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12822">4</sup> Then the king extended the gold scepter
to Esther and she arose and stood before him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12823">5</sup> “If it
pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and
thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let
an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of
Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in
all the king’s provinces. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12824">6</sup> For how can I bear to see disaster fall
on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my
family?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12825">7</sup> King
Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because
Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and
they have hanged him on the gallows. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12826">8</sup> Now write another decree in the king’s
name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with
the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name
and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12827">9</sup> At
once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of
the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s
orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the
127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12827a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> These orders were written in the
script of each province and the language of each people and also to
the Jews in their own script and language. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12828">10</sup> Mordecai wrote in the name of King
Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent
them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for
the king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12829">11</sup> The
king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble
and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate any armed
force of any nationality or province that might attack them and
their women and children; and to plunder the property of their
enemies. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12830">12</sup> The
day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King
Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of
Adar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12831">13</sup> A copy
of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province
and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews
would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their
enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12832">14</sup> The
couriers, riding the royal horses, raced out, spurred on by the
king’s command. And the edict was also issued in the citadel of
Susa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12833">15</sup>
Mordecai left the king’s presence wearing royal garments of blue
and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen.
And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12834">16</sup> For the Jews it was a
time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12835">17</sup> In every province and in
every city, wherever the edict of the king went, there was joy and
gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many
people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews
had seized them.</p>
