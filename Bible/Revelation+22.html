<h4>Revelation 22</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The River of Life</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31066">1</sup> Then the
angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as
crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31067">2</sup> down the middle of the
great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree
of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every
month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the
nations. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31068">3</sup> No
longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb
will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31069">4</sup> They will see his face,
and his name will be on their foreheads. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31070">5</sup> There will be no more night. They will
not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord
God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31071">6</sup> The
angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord,
the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his
servants the things that must soon take place.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Is Coming</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31072">7</sup> “Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he
who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31073">8</sup> I,
John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had
heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the
angel who had been showing them to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31074">9</sup> But he said to me, “Do not do it! I am a
fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of
all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31075">10</sup> Then
he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book,
because the time is near. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31076">11</sup> Let him who does wrong continue to do
wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does
right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be
holy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31077">12</sup> “Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is
with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has
done.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31078">13</sup> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First
and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31079">14</sup> “Blessed are those who wash their
robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go
through the gates into the city.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31080">15</sup> Outside
are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral,
the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices
falsehood.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31081">16</sup> “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give
you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-31081a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> this testimony for the churches. I
am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning
Star.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31082">17</sup> The
Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say,
“Come!” Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let
him take the free gift of the water of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31083">18</sup> I
warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If
anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues
described in this book. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-31084">19</sup> And if anyone takes words away from
this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the
tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this
book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31085">20</sup> He
who testifies to these things says, <font class='woj'>“Yes, I am
coming soon.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-31086">21</sup> The
grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.</p>
