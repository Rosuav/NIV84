<h4>Philippians 4</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29428">1</sup>
Therefore, my brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and
crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear
friends!</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Exhortations</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29429">2</sup> I plead
with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in
the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29430">3</sup> Yes,
and I ask you, loyal yokefellow,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29430a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> help
these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the
gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose
names are in the book of life.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29431">4</sup>
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29432">5</sup> Let your
gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29433">6</sup> Do not be anxious about
anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with
thanksgiving, present your requests to God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29434">7</sup> And the peace of God, which
transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds
in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29435">8</sup>
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is
right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such
things. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29436">9</sup>
Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in
me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Thanks for Their Gifts</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29437">10</sup> I
rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your
concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no
opportunity to show it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29438">11</sup> I am not saying this because I am in
need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29439">12</sup> I know what it
is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have
learned the secret of being content in any and every situation,
whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29440">13</sup> I can do
everything through him who gives me strength.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29441">14</sup> Yet
it was good of you to share in my troubles. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29442">15</sup> Moreover, as you Philippians know,
in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set
out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of
giving and receiving, except you only; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29443">16</sup> for even when I was in Thessalonica,
you sent me aid again and again when I was in need. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29444">17</sup> Not that I am looking for
a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29445">18</sup> I have
received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that
I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a
fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29446">19</sup> And my God
will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29447">20</sup> To
our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29448">21</sup> Greet
all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send
greetings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29449">22</sup> All
the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to
Caesar’s household.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29450">23</sup> The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Amen.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29450b" title=
