<h4>Romans 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Living Sacrifices</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28232">1</sup>
Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer
your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is
your spiritual<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28232a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> act of worship. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28233">2</sup> Do not conform any longer
to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s
will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28234">3</sup> For by
the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of
yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself
with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God
has given you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28235">4</sup>
Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these
members do not all have the same function, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28236">5</sup> so in Christ we who are many form one
body, and each member belongs to all the others. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28237">6</sup> We have different gifts,
according to the grace given us. If a man’s gift is prophesying,
let him use it in proportion to his<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28237b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> faith.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28238">7</sup> If it is
serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28239">8</sup> if it is
encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs
of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him
govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it
cheerfully.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Love</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28240">9</sup> Love must
be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28241">10</sup> Be devoted to one another
in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28242">11</sup> Never be lacking in zeal,
but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28243">12</sup> Be joyful in hope,
patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28244">13</sup> Share with God’s people who are in
need. Practice hospitality.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28245">14</sup> Bless
those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28246">15</sup> Rejoice with those who
rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28247">16</sup> Live in harmony with one another. Do
not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low
position.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28247c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> Do not be conceited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28248">17</sup> Do
not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in
the eyes of everybody. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28249">18</sup> If it is possible, as far as it depends
on you, live at peace with everyone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28250">19</sup> Do not take revenge, my friends, but
leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to
avenge; I will repay,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28250d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> says the
Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28251">20</sup> On the
contrary:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he is thirsty, give him something to
drink.<br>
In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”<sup class=

"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28252">21</sup> Do
not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
