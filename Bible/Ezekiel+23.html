<h5 class="passage-header">Two Adulterous Sisters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21009">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21010">2</sup> “Son of man, there were two women,
daughters of the same mother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21011">3</sup> They became prostitutes in Egypt,
engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their
breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21012">4</sup> The older was named
Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth
to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is
Jerusalem.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21013">5</sup>
“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she
lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21014">6</sup> clothed in blue, governors
and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted
horsemen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21015">7</sup> She
gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and
defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21016">8</sup> She did not
give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth
men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their
lust upon her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21017">9</sup>
“Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom
she lusted. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21018">10</sup>
They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and
killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and
punishment was inflicted on her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21019">11</sup> “Her
sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was
more depraved than her sister. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21020">12</sup> She too lusted after the
Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted
horsemen, all handsome young men. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21021">13</sup> I saw that she too defiled herself;
both of them went the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21022">14</sup> “But
she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed
on a wall, figures of Chaldeans<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21022a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> portrayed
in red, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21023">15</sup> with
belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all
of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of
Chaldea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21023b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21024">16</sup> As soon as she saw them, she lusted
after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21025">17</sup> Then the Babylonians came
to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her.
After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in
disgust. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21026">18</sup> When
she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I
turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her
sister. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21027">19</sup> Yet
she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of
her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21028">20</sup> There she lusted after
her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose
emission was like that of horses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21029">21</sup> So you longed for the lewdness of your
youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts
fondled.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21029c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21030">22</sup>
“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will
stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in
disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21031">23</sup> the
Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and
Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of
them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high
rank, all mounted on horses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21032">24</sup> They will come against you with
weapons,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21032d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> chariots and wagons and with a throng
of people; they will take up positions against you on every side
with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over
to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their
standards. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21033">25</sup> I
will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with
you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those
of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away
your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be
consumed by fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21034">26</sup> They will also strip you of your
clothes and take your fine jewelry. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21035">27</sup> So I will put a stop to the lewdness
and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these
things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21036">28</sup> “For
this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to hand you over
to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21037">29</sup> They will deal
with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for.
They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your
prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21038">30</sup> have brought
this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled
yourself with their idols. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21039">31</sup> You have gone the way of your sister;
so I will put her cup into your hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21040">32</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You will drink your sister’s cup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cup large and deep;<br>
it will bring scorn and derision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it holds so much.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21041">33</sup> You will be
filled with drunkenness and sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cup of ruin and desolation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cup of your sister Samaria.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21042">34</sup> You will drink
it and drain it dry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will dash it to pieces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tear your breasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken, declares the Sovereign
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21043">35</sup>
“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have
forgotten me and thrust me behind your back, you must bear the
consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21044">36</sup> The
LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?
Then confront them with their detestable practices, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21045">37</sup> for they have committed
adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with
their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to
me,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21045e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> as food for them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21046">38</sup> They have also done this
to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated
my Sabbaths. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21047">39</sup>
On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they
entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my
house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21048">40</sup> “They
even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they
arrived you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes and put on
your jewelry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21049">41</sup>
You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which
you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21050">42</sup> “The
noise of a carefree crowd was around her; Sabeans<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21050f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> were brought from the desert along
with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the arms of the
woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21051">43</sup> Then I said
about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a
prostitute, for that is all she is.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21052">44</sup> And they slept with her. As men sleep
with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and
Oholibah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21053">45</sup> But
righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who
commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and
blood is on their hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21054">46</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give
them over to terror and plunder. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21055">47</sup> The mob will stone them and cut them
down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and
burn down their houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21056">48</sup> “So I
will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take
warning and not imitate you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21057">49</sup> You will suffer the penalty for your
lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then
you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.”</p>
