<h4>Genesis 45</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph Makes Himself Known</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1360">1</sup> Then
Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants,
and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was
no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1361">2</sup> And he wept so
loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard
about it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1362">3</sup> Joseph
said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But
his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were
terrified at his presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1363">4</sup> Then
Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done
so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into
Egypt! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1364">5</sup> And now,
do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for
selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me
ahead of you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1365">6</sup>
For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the
next five years there will not be plowing and reaping. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1366">7</sup> But God sent me ahead of
you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives
by a great deliverance.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1366a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1367">8</sup> “So
then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father
to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1368">9</sup> Now hurry back
to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says:
God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1369">10</sup> You shall live
in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and
grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1370">11</sup> I will provide for you
there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise
you and your household and all who belong to you will become
destitute.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1371">12</sup> “You
can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is
really I who am speaking to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1372">13</sup> Tell my father about all the honor
accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring
my father down here quickly.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1373">14</sup> Then
he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and
Benjamin embraced him, weeping. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1374">15</sup> And he kissed all his brothers and wept
over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1375">16</sup> When
the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come,
Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1376">17</sup> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your
brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of
Canaan, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1377">18</sup> and
bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the
best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the
land.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1378">19</sup> “You
are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from
Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and
come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1379">20</sup> Never
mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be
yours.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1380">21</sup> So the
sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had
commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1381">22</sup> To each of them
he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1381b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of silver and five sets of
clothes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1382">23</sup> And
this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the
best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and
bread and other provisions for his journey. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1383">24</sup> Then he sent his brothers away, and
as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the
way!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1384">25</sup> So
they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the
land of Canaan. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1385">26</sup>
They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all
Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1386">27</sup> But when they told him
everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts
Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob
revived. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1387">28</sup> And
Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will
go and see him before I die.”</p>
