<h4>Ezekiel 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The End Has Come</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20579">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20580">2</sup> “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign
LORD says to the land of Israel: The end! The end has come upon the
four corners of the land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20581">3</sup> The end is now upon you and I will
unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your
conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20582">4</sup> I will not look
on you with pity or spare you; I will surely repay you for your
conduct and the detestable practices among you. Then you will know
that I am the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20583">5</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says: Disaster! An unheard-of<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20583a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> disaster is coming. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20584">6</sup> The end has come! The end
has come! It has roused itself against you. It has come!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20585">7</sup> Doom has come
upon you—you who dwell in the land. The time has come, the day is
near; there is panic, not joy, upon the mountains. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20586">8</sup> I am about to pour out my
wrath on you and spend my anger against you; I will judge you
according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable
practices. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20587">9</sup> I
will not look on you with pity or spare you; I will repay you in
accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among
you. Then you will know that it is I the LORD who strikes the
blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20588">10</sup> “The
day is here! It has come! Doom has burst forth, the rod has budded,
arrogance has blossomed! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20589">11</sup> Violence has grown into<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20589b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> a rod to punish wickedness; none of
the people will be left, none of that crowd—no wealth, nothing of
value. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20590">12</sup> The
time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor
the seller grieve, for wrath is upon the whole crowd. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20591">13</sup> The seller will not
recover the land he has sold as long as both of them live, for the
vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of
their sins, not one of them will preserve his life. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20592">14</sup> Though they blow the
trumpet and get everything ready, no one will go into battle, for
my wrath is upon the whole crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20593">15</sup>
“Outside is the sword, inside are plague and famine; those in the
country will die by the sword, and those in the city will be
devoured by famine and plague. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20594">16</sup> All who survive and escape will be in
the mountains, moaning like doves of the valleys, each because of
his sins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20595">17</sup>
Every hand will go limp, and every knee will become as weak as
water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20596">18</sup> They
will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror. Their faces will
be covered with shame and their heads will be shaved. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20597">19</sup> They will throw their
silver into the streets, and their gold will be an unclean thing.
Their silver and gold will not be able to save them in the day of
the LORD’s wrath. They will not satisfy their hunger or fill their
stomachs with it, for it has made them stumble into sin.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20598">20</sup> They were
proud of their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their
detestable idols and vile images. Therefore I will turn these into
an unclean thing for them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20599">21</sup> I will hand it all over as plunder to
foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, and they will
defile it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20600">22</sup> I
will turn my face away from them, and they will desecrate my
treasured place; robbers will enter it and desecrate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20601">23</sup>
“Prepare chains, because the land is full of bloodshed and the city
is full of violence. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20602">24</sup> I will bring the most wicked of the
nations to take possession of their houses; I will put an end to
the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20603">25</sup> When terror
comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20604">26</sup> Calamity upon calamity
will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will try to get a vision from
the prophet; the teaching of the law by the priest will be lost, as
will the counsel of the elders. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20605">27</sup> The king will mourn, the prince will be
clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will
tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by
their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I
am the LORD.”</p>
