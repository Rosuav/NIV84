<h4>Isaiah 29</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Woe to David’s City</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18195">1</sup> Woe to
you, Ariel, Ariel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city where David settled!<br>
Add year to year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let your cycle of festivals go on.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18196">2</sup> Yet I will
besiege Ariel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will mourn and lament,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will be to me like an altar
hearth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18196a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18197">3</sup> I will encamp
against you all around;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will encircle you with towers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set up my siege works against you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18198">4</sup> Brought low,
you will speak from the ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your speech will mumble out of the dust.<br>
Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the dust your speech will whisper.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18199">5</sup> But
your many enemies will become like fine dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruthless hordes like blown chaff.<br>
Suddenly, in an instant,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18200">6</sup> the LORD
Almighty will come<br>
with thunder and earthquake and great noise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with windstorm and tempest and flames of a
devouring fire.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18201">7</sup> Then the hordes
of all the nations that fight against Ariel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that attack her and her fortress and besiege
her,<br>
will be as it is with a dream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a vision in the night—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18202">8</sup> as when a
hungry man dreams that he is eating,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he awakens, and his hunger remains;<br>
as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he awakens faint, with his thirst
unquenched.<br>
So will it be with the hordes of all the nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that fight against Mount Zion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18203">9</sup> Be
stunned and amazed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind yourselves and be sightless;<br>
be drunk, but not from wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stagger, but not from beer.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18204">10</sup> The LORD has
brought over you a deep sleep:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has sealed your eyes (the prophets);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has covered your heads (the seers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18205">11</sup> For
you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And
if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him,
“Read this, please,” he will answer, “I can’t; it is sealed.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18206">12</sup> Or if you give
the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this,
please,” he will answer, “I don’t know how to read.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18207">13</sup> The
Lord says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These people come near to me with their
mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and honor me with their lips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but their hearts are far from me.<br>
Their worship of me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is made up only of rules taught by
men.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18207b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18208">14</sup> Therefore once
more I will astound these people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with wonder upon wonder;<br>
the wisdom of the wise will perish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the intelligence of the intelligent will
vanish.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18209">15</sup> Woe to those
who go to great depths<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to hide their plans from the LORD,<br>
who do their work in darkness and think,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who sees us? Who will know?”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18210">16</sup> You turn
things upside down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if the potter were thought to be like the
clay!<br>
Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He did not make me”?<br>
Can the pot say of the potter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He knows nothing”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18211">17</sup> In a
very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile
field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fertile field seem like a forest?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18212">18</sup> In that day
the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and out of gloom and darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eyes of the blind will see.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18213">19</sup> Once more the
humble will rejoice in the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of
Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18214">20</sup> The ruthless
will vanish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mockers will disappear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all who have an eye for evil will be cut
down—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18215">21</sup> those who with
a word make a man out to be guilty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who ensnare the defender in court<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with false testimony deprive the innocent of
justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18216">22</sup>
Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the
house of Jacob:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No longer will Jacob be ashamed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no longer will their faces grow pale.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18217">23</sup> When they see
among them their children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of my hands,<br>
they will keep my name holy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy
One of Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18218">24</sup> Those who are
wayward in spirit will gain understanding;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who complain will accept instruction.”</p>
