<h4>Genesis 23</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Sarah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-573">1</sup> Sarah lived
to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-574">2</sup> She died at Kiriath Arba (that is,
Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah
and to weep over her.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-575">3</sup> Then
Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the
Hittites.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-575a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> He said, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-576">4</sup> “I am an alien and a stranger among you.
Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my
dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-577">5</sup> The
Hittites replied to Abraham, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-578">6</sup> “Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty
prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None
of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-579">7</sup> Then
Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the
Hittites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-580">8</sup> He said
to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to
me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-581">9</sup> so he will sell me the cave
of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field.
Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among
you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-582">10</sup> Ephron
the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham
in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his
city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-583">11</sup> “No, my
lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-583b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> you the field, and I
give<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-583c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> you the cave that is in it. I
give<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-583d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> it to you in the presence of my
people. Bury your dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-584">12</sup> Again
Abraham bowed down before the people of the land <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-585">13</sup> and he said to Ephron in
their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of
the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-586">14</sup> Ephron
answered Abraham, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-587">15</sup> “Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth
four hundred shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-587e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> of
silver, but what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-588">16</sup> Abraham
agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had
named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of
silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-589">17</sup> So
Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave
in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-590">18</sup> to Abraham as
his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to
the gate of the city. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-591">19</sup> Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah
in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at
Hebron) in the land of Canaan. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-592">20</sup> So the field and the cave in it were
deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.</p>
