&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A <i>maskil</i><sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-15115a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of Asaph.</b>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15115">1</sup> O my
people, hear my teaching;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15116">2</sup> I will open my
mouth in parables,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will utter hidden things, things from of
old—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15117">3</sup> what we have
heard and known,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what our fathers have told us.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15118">4</sup> We will not
hide them from their children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will tell the next generation<br>
the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his power, and the wonders he has done.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15119">5</sup> He decreed
statutes for Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and established the law in Israel,<br>
which he commanded our forefathers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to teach their children,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15120">6</sup> so the next
generation would know them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the children yet to be born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they in turn would tell their children.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15121">7</sup> Then they would
put their trust in God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and would not forget his deeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but would keep his commands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15122">8</sup> They would not
be like their forefathers—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br>
whose hearts were not loyal to God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose spirits were not faithful to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15123">9</sup> The
men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned back on the day of battle;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15124">10</sup> they did not
keep God’s covenant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refused to live by his law.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15125">11</sup> They forgot
what he had done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wonders he had shown them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15126">12</sup> He did
miracles in the sight of their fathers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15127">13</sup> He divided the
sea and led them through;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he made the water stand firm like a wall.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15128">14</sup> He guided them
with the cloud by day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with light from the fire all night.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15129">15</sup> He split the
rocks in the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave them water as abundant as the seas;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15130">16</sup> he brought
streams out of a rocky crag<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made water flow down like rivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15131">17</sup> But
they continued to sin against him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebelling in the desert against the Most
High.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15132">18</sup> They willfully
put God to the test<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by demanding the food they craved.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15133">19</sup> They spoke
against God, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can God spread a table in the desert?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15134">20</sup> When he struck
the rock, water gushed out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams flowed abundantly.<br>
But can he also give us food?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he supply meat for his people?”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15135">21</sup> When the LORD
heard them, he was very angry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his fire broke out against Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his wrath rose against Israel,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15136">22</sup> for they did
not believe in God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or trust in his deliverance.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15137">23</sup> Yet he gave a
command to the skies above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and opened the doors of the heavens;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15138">24</sup> he rained down
manna for the people to eat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave them the grain of heaven.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15139">25</sup> Men ate the
bread of angels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sent them all the food they could eat.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15140">26</sup> He let loose
the east wind from the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and led forth the south wind by his power.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15141">27</sup> He rained meat
down on them like dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flying birds like sand on the seashore.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15142">28</sup> He made them
come down inside their camp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all around their tents.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15143">29</sup> They ate till
they had more than enough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he had given them what they craved.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15144">30</sup> But before
they turned from the food they craved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even while it was still in their mouths,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15145">31</sup> God’s anger
rose against them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he put to death the sturdiest among them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cutting down the young men of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15146">32</sup> In
spite of all this, they kept on sinning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in spite of his wonders, they did not
believe.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15147">33</sup> So he ended
their days in futility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their years in terror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15148">34</sup> Whenever God
slew them, they would seek him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they eagerly turned to him again.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15149">35</sup> They
remembered that God was their Rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that God Most High was their Redeemer.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15150">36</sup> But then they
would flatter him with their mouths,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying to him with their tongues;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15151">37</sup> their hearts
were not loyal to him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were not faithful to his covenant.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15152">38</sup> Yet he was
merciful;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he forgave their iniquities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not destroy them.<br>
Time after time he restrained his anger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not stir up his full wrath.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15153">39</sup> He remembered
that they were but flesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a passing breeze that does not return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15154">40</sup> How
often they rebelled against him in the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grieved him in the wasteland!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15155">41</sup> Again and
again they put God to the test;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they vexed the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15156">42</sup> They did not
remember his power—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15157">43</sup> the day he
displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wonders in the region of Zoan.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15158">44</sup> He turned
their rivers to blood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they could not drink from their streams.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15159">45</sup> He sent swarms
of flies that devoured them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and frogs that devastated them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15160">46</sup> He gave their
crops to the grasshopper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their produce to the locust.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15161">47</sup> He destroyed
their vines with hail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their sycamore-figs with sleet.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15162">48</sup> He gave over
their cattle to the hail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their livestock to bolts of lightning.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15163">49</sup> He unleashed
against them his hot anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wrath, indignation and hostility—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a band of destroying angels.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15164">50</sup> He prepared a
path for his anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not spare them from death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gave them over to the plague.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15165">51</sup> He struck down
all the firstborn of Egypt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of
Ham.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15166">52</sup> But he brought
his people out like a flock;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he led them like sheep through the desert.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15167">53</sup> He guided them
safely, so they were unafraid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the sea engulfed their enemies.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15168">54</sup> Thus he
brought them to the border of his holy land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the hill country his right hand had taken.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15169">55</sup> He drove out
nations before them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and allotted their lands to them as an
inheritance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he settled the tribes of Israel in their
homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15170">56</sup> But
they put God to the test<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rebelled against the Most High;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they did not keep his statutes.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15171">57</sup> Like their
fathers they were disloyal and faithless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as unreliable as a faulty bow.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15172">58</sup> They angered
him with their high places;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they aroused his jealousy with their idols.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15173">59</sup> When God heard
them, he was very angry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he rejected Israel completely.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15174">60</sup> He abandoned
the tabernacle of Shiloh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tent he had set up among men.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15175">61</sup> He sent the
ark of his might into captivity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his splendor into the hands of the enemy.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15176">62</sup> He gave his
people over to the sword;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was very angry with his inheritance.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15177">63</sup> Fire consumed
their young men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their maidens had no wedding songs;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15178">64</sup> their priests
were put to the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their widows could not weep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15179">65</sup> Then
the Lord awoke as from sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15180">66</sup> He beat back
his enemies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he put them to everlasting shame.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15181">67</sup> Then he
rejected the tents of Joseph,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15182">68</sup> but he chose
the tribe of Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Zion, which he loved.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15183">69</sup> He built his
sanctuary like the heights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the earth that he established forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15184">70</sup> He chose David
his servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took him from the sheep pens;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15185">71</sup> from tending
the sheep he brought him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be the shepherd of his people Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel his inheritance.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-15186">72</sup> And David
shepherded them with integrity of heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with skillful hands he led them.</p>
