<h4>2 Samuel 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Absalom’s Conspiracy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8391">1</sup> In the
course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses
and with fifty men to run ahead of him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8392">2</sup> He would get up early and stand by the
side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came
with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision,
Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would
answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8393">3</sup> Then Absalom
would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but
there is no representative of the king to hear you.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8394">4</sup> And Absalom would add, “If
only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a
complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets
justice.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8395">5</sup> Also,
whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom
would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8396">6</sup> Absalom behaved
in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking
for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8397">7</sup> At the
end of four<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8397a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> years, Absalom said to the
king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8398">8</sup> While your
servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the LORD
takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in
Hebron.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8398b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8399">9</sup> The
king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8400">10</sup> Then
Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to
say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say,
‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8401">11</sup> Two hundred men from Jerusalem had
accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite
innocently, knowing nothing about the matter. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8402">12</sup> While Absalom was offering
sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s
counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy
gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Flees</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8403">13</sup> A
messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the men of Israel are
with Absalom.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8404">14</sup> Then
David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem,
“Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We
must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and
bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8405">15</sup> The
king’s officials answered him, “Your servants are ready to do
whatever our lord the king chooses.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8406">16</sup> The
king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left
ten concubines to take care of the palace. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8407">17</sup> So the king set out, with all the
people following him, and they halted at a place some distance
away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8408">18</sup> All his
men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites;
and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath
marched before the king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8409">19</sup> The
king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come along with us?
Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile
from your homeland. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8410">20</sup> You came only yesterday. And today shall
I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am
going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and
faithfulness be with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8411">21</sup> But
Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the LORD lives, and as my
lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it
means life or death, there will your servant be.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8412">22</sup> David
said to Ittai, “Go ahead, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched
on with all his men and the families that were with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8413">23</sup> The
whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king
also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward
the desert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8414">24</sup> Zadok
was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying
the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and
Abiathar offered sacrifices<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8414c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> until
all the people had finished leaving the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8415">25</sup> Then
the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back into the city. If
I find favor in the LORD’s eyes, he will bring me back and let me
see it and his dwelling place again. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8416">26</sup> But if he says, ‘I am not pleased with
you,’ then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to
him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8417">27</sup> The
king also said to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Go back to
the city in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of
Abiathar. You and Abiathar take your two sons with you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8418">28</sup> I will wait at the fords
in the desert until word comes from you to inform me.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8419">29</sup> So Zadok and Abiathar took
the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8420">30</sup> But
David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his
head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him
covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8421">31</sup> Now David had
been told, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So
David prayed, “O LORD, turn Ahithophel’s counsel into
foolishness.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8422">32</sup> When
David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God,
Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on
his head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8423">33</sup> David
said to him, “If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8424">34</sup> But if you
return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O
king; I was your father’s servant in the past, but now I will be
your servant,’ then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel’s
advice. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8425">35</sup> Won’t
the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them
anything you hear in the king’s palace. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8426">36</sup> Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and
Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with
anything you hear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8427">37</sup> So
David’s friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering
the city.</p>
