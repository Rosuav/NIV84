<h4>Job 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zophar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13328">1</sup> Then
Zophar the Naamathite replied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13329">2</sup> “My
troubled thoughts prompt me to answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because I am greatly disturbed.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13330">3</sup> I hear a rebuke
that dishonors me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my understanding inspires me to reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13331">4</sup>
“Surely you know how it has been from of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever since man<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-13331a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> was
placed on the earth,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13332">5</sup> that the mirth
of the wicked is brief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13333">6</sup> Though his
pride reaches to the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his head touches the clouds,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13334">7</sup> he will perish
forever, like his own dung;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is
he?’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13335">8</sup> Like a dream he
flies away, no more to be found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;banished like a vision of the night.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13336">9</sup> The eye that
saw him will not see him again;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his place will look on him no more.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13337">10</sup> His children
must make amends to the poor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own hands must give back his wealth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13338">11</sup> The youthful
vigor that fills his bones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will lie with him in the dust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13339">12</sup>
“Though evil is sweet in his mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he hides it under his tongue,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13340">13</sup> though he
cannot bear to let it go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and keeps it in his mouth,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13341">14</sup> yet his food
will turn sour in his stomach;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will become the venom of serpents within
him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13342">15</sup> He will spit
out the riches he swallowed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will make his stomach vomit them up.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13343">16</sup> He will suck
the poison of serpents;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fangs of an adder will kill him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13344">17</sup> He will not
enjoy the streams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rivers flowing with honey and cream.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13345">18</sup> What he toiled
for he must give back uneaten;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not enjoy the profit from his
trading.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13346">19</sup> For he has
oppressed the poor and left them destitute;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has seized houses he did not build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13347">20</sup>
“Surely he will have no respite from his craving;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he cannot save himself by his treasure.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13348">21</sup> Nothing is
left for him to devour;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his prosperity will not endure.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13349">22</sup> In the midst
of his plenty, distress will overtake him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the full force of misery will come upon him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13350">23</sup> When he has
filled his belly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will vent his burning anger against him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rain down his blows upon him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13351">24</sup> Though he
flees from an iron weapon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13352">25</sup> He pulls it
out of his back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gleaming point out of his liver.<br>
Terrors will come over him;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13353">26</sup> total
darkness lies in wait for his treasures.<br>
A fire unfanned will consume him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and devour what is left in his tent.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13354">27</sup> The heavens
will expose his guilt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth will rise up against him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13355">28</sup> A flood will
carry off his house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rushing waters<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

day of God’s wrath.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13356">29</sup> Such is the
fate God allots the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heritage appointed for them by God.”</p>
