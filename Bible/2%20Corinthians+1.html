<h4>2 Corinthians 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28786">1</sup> Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our
brother,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the church of God in Corinth, together with
all the saints throughout Achaia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28787">2</sup> Grace
and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The God of All Comfort</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28788">3</sup> Praise be
to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
compassion and the God of all comfort, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28789">4</sup> who comforts us in all our troubles, so
that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we
ourselves have received from God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28790">5</sup> For just as the sufferings of Christ
flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort
overflows. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28791">6</sup> If
we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are
comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient
endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28792">7</sup> And our hope for you is firm, because
we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share
in our comfort.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28793">8</sup> We do
not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we
suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far
beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28794">9</sup> Indeed, in our
hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we
might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28795">10</sup> He has
delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On
him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28796">11</sup> as you help us
by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28796a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> behalf for the gracious favor
granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Change of Plans</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28797">12</sup> Now this
is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted
ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you,
in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so
not according to worldly wisdom but according to God’s grace.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28798">13</sup> For we do not
write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28799">14</sup> as you have
understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you
can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord
Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28800">15</sup>
Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so
that you might benefit twice. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28801">16</sup> I planned to visit you on my way to
Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have
you send me on my way to Judea. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28802">17</sup> When I planned this, did I do it
lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the
same breath I say, “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28803">18</sup> But
as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and
“No.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28804">19</sup> For the
Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and
Silas<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28804b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and Timothy, was not “Yes” and
“No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28805">20</sup> For no matter how many promises God
has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen”
is spoken by us to the glory of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28806">21</sup> Now it is God who makes both us and you
stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28807">22</sup> set his seal of ownership on us, and
put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to
come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28808">23</sup> I
call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did
not return to Corinth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28809">24</sup> Not that we lord it over your faith,
but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand
firm.</p>
