<h4>Deuteronomy 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Driving Out the Nations</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5113">1</sup> When the
LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess
and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites,
Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven
nations larger and stronger than you— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5114">2</sup> and when the LORD your God has delivered
them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy
them totally.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5114a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Make no treaty with them,
and show them no mercy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5115">3</sup> Do not intermarry with them. Do not give
your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5116">4</sup> for they will
turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods, and the
LORD’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5117">5</sup> This is what you
are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred
stones, cut down their Asherah poles<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5117b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and
burn their idols in the fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5118">6</sup> For you are a people holy to the LORD
your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples
on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured
possession.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5119">7</sup> The
LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you
were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of
all peoples. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5120">8</sup> But
it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to
your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and
redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh
king of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5121">9</sup>
Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful
God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of
those who love him and keep his commands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5122">10</sup> But</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who hate him he will repay to their face
by destruction;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not be slow to repay to their face those
who hate him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5123">11</sup>
Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I
give you today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5124">12</sup> If you
pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then
the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he
swore to your forefathers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5125">13</sup> He will love you and bless you and
increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the
crops of your land—your grain, new wine and oil—the calves of your
herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to
your forefathers to give you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5126">14</sup> You will be blessed more than any other
people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor any of
your livestock without young. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5127">15</sup> The LORD will keep you free from every
disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew
in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5128">16</sup> You must destroy all the
peoples the LORD your God gives over to you. Do not look on them
with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to
you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5129">17</sup> You
may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How
can we drive them out?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5130">18</sup> But do not be afraid of them; remember
well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5131">19</sup> You saw with
your own eyes the great trials, the miraculous signs and wonders,
the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the LORD your God
brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the
peoples you now fear. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5132">20</sup> Moreover, the LORD your God will send
the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you
have perished. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5133">21</sup>
Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among
you, is a great and awesome God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5134">22</sup> The LORD your God will drive out those
nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to
eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply
around you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5135">23</sup> But
the LORD your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into
great confusion until they are destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5136">24</sup> He will give their kings into your hand,
and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be
able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5137">25</sup> The images of their gods
you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on
them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by
it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5138">26</sup> Do not bring a detestable
thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for
destruction. Utterly abhor and detest it, for it is set apart for
destruction.</p>
