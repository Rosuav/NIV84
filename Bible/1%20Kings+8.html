<h4>1 Kings 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Ark Brought to the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8987">1</sup> Then King
Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of
Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite
families, to bring up the ark of the LORD’s covenant from Zion, the
City of David. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8988">2</sup>
All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of
the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8989">3</sup> When
all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8990">4</sup> and they brought
up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred
furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8991">5</sup> and King Solomon
and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were
before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they
could not be recorded or counted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8992">6</sup> The
priests then brought the ark of the LORD’s covenant to its place in
the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it
beneath the wings of the cherubim. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8993">7</sup> The cherubim spread their wings over the
place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8994">8</sup> These poles were
so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front
of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and
they are still there today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8995">9</sup> There was nothing in the ark except the
two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the
LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of
Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8996">10</sup> When
the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the
temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8997">11</sup> And the priests could not perform their
service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled his
temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8998">12</sup> Then
Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark
cloud; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8999">13</sup> I have
indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell
forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9000">14</sup> While
the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned
around and blessed them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9001">15</sup> Then he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who
with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth
to my father David. For he said, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9002">16</sup> ‘Since the day I brought my people
Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of
Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, but I have
chosen David to rule my people Israel.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9003">17</sup> “My
father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of
the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9004">18</sup> But the LORD said to my father David,
‘Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you
did well to have this in your heart. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9005">19</sup> Nevertheless, you are not the one to
build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood—he
is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9006">20</sup> “The
LORD has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father
and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised,
and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9007">21</sup> I have
provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the
LORD that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of
Egypt.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9008">22</sup> Then
Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole
assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9009">23</sup> and said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like
you in heaven above or on earth below—you who keep your covenant of
love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9010">24</sup> You have kept
your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you
have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is
today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9011">25</sup> “Now
LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the
promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to
have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your
sons are careful in all they do to walk before me as you have
done.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9012">26</sup> And now,
O God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David
my father come true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9013">27</sup> “But
will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest
heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9014">28</sup> Yet give
attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD
my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in
your presence this day. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9015">29</sup> May your eyes be open toward this temple
night and day, this place of which you said, ‘My Name shall be
there,’ so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward
this place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9016">30</sup>
Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel
when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling
place, and when you hear, forgive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9017">31</sup> “When
a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he
comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9018">32</sup> then hear from
heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty
and bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the
innocent not guilty, and so establish his innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9019">33</sup> “When
your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have
sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and confess your
name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9020">34</sup> then hear from
heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them
back to the land you gave to their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9021">35</sup> “When
the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people
have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and
confess your name and turn from their sin because you have
afflicted them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9022">36</sup>
then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your
people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on
the land you gave your people for an inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9023">37</sup> “When
famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or
grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their
cities, whatever disaster or disease may come, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9024">38</sup> and when a prayer or plea
is made by any of your people Israel—each one aware of the
afflictions of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward
this temple— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9025">39</sup>
then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal
with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart
(for you alone know the hearts of all men), <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9026">40</sup> so that they will fear you all the
time they live in the land you gave our fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9027">41</sup> “As
for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has
come from a distant land because of your name— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9028">42</sup> for men will hear of your
great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when he
comes and prays toward this temple, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9029">43</sup> then hear from heaven, your dwelling
place, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the
peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your
own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears
your Name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9030">44</sup> “When
your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send
them, and when they pray to the LORD toward the city you have
chosen and the temple I have built for your Name, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9031">45</sup> then hear from heaven
their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9032">46</sup> “When
they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you
become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes
them captive to his own land, far away or near; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9033">47</sup> and if they have a change
of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and
plead with you in the land of their conquerors and say, ‘We have
sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly’; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9034">48</sup> and if they turn back to
you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who
took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their
fathers, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have
built for your Name; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9035">49</sup> then from heaven, your dwelling place,
hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9036">50</sup> And forgive
your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses
they have committed against you, and cause their conquerors to show
them mercy; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9037">51</sup> for
they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of
Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9038">52</sup> “May
your eyes be open to your servant’s plea and to the plea of your
people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9039">53</sup> For you
singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own
inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when
you, O Sovereign LORD, brought our fathers out of Egypt.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9040">54</sup> When
Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the
LORD, he rose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had been
kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9041">55</sup> He stood and blessed the
whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9042">56</sup>
“Praise be to the LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel
just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good
promises he gave through his servant Moses. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9043">57</sup> May the LORD our God be with us as he
was with our fathers; may he never leave us nor forsake us.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9044">58</sup> May he turn our
hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep the commands,
decrees and regulations he gave our fathers. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9045">59</sup> And may these words of mine, which I
have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and
night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of
his people Israel according to each day’s need, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9046">60</sup> so that all the peoples of
the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9047">61</sup> But your hearts
must be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by his decrees
and obey his commands, as at this time.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Dedication of the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9048">62</sup> Then the
king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9049">63</sup> Solomon offered
a sacrifice of fellowship offerings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9049a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to the
LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand
sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the
temple of the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9050">64</sup> On
that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard
in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt
offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings,
because the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to hold the
burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship
offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9051">65</sup> So
Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with
him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9051b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They
celebrated it before the LORD our God for seven days and seven days
more, fourteen days in all. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9052">66</sup> On the following day he sent the people
away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in
heart for all the good things the LORD had done for his servant
David and his people Israel.</p>
