<h4>Genesis 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Abram Rescues Lot</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-338">1</sup> At this
time Amraphel king of Shinar,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-338a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Arioch
king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-339">2</sup> went to war
against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of
Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,
Zoar). <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-340">3</sup> All these
latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt
Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-340b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>). <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-341">4</sup> For twelve years they had been subject to
Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-342">5</sup> In the
fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out
and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in
Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-343">6</sup> and the Horites in the hill country of
Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-344">7</sup> Then they turned back and went to En
Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory
of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in
Hazazon Tamar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-345">8</sup> Then the
king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of
Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew
up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-346">9</sup> against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal
king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of
Ellasar—four kings against five. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-347">10</sup> Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar
pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the
men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-348">11</sup> The four kings seized all
the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went
away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-349">12</sup> They also
carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was
living in Sodom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-350">13</sup> One who
had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram
was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a
brother<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-350c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom
were allied with Abram. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-351">14</sup> When Abram heard that his relative had
been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his
household and went in pursuit as far as Dan. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-352">15</sup> During the night Abram divided his men
to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah,
north of Damascus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-353">16</sup> He recovered all the goods and brought
back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women
and the other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-354">17</sup> After
Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with
him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh
(that is, the King’s Valley).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-355">18</sup> Then
Melchizedek king of Salem<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-355d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> brought
out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-356">19</sup> and he blessed Abram,
saying,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blessed be Abram by God Most High,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creator<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-356e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> of
heaven and earth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-357">20</sup> And blessed
be<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-357f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> God Most High,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who delivered your enemies into your hand.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-358">21</sup> The
king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods
for yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-359">22</sup> But
Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the
LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an
oath <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-360">23</sup> that I will
accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the thong of
a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram
rich.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-361">24</sup> I will
accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that
belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let
them have their share.”</p>
