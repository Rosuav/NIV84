<h4>Isaiah 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">To Us a Child Is Born</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17831">1</sup>
Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in
distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land
of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the
Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan—
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17832">2</sup> The
people walking in darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have seen a great light;<br>
on those living in the land of the shadow of death<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17832a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a light has dawned.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17833">3</sup> You have
enlarged the nation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and increased their joy;<br>
they rejoice before you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as people rejoice at the harvest,<br>
as men rejoice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when dividing the plunder.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17834">4</sup> For as in the
day of Midian’s defeat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have shattered<br>
the yoke that burdens them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bar across their shoulders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rod of their oppressor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17835">5</sup> Every warrior’s
boot used in battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every garment rolled in blood<br>
will be destined for burning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be fuel for the fire.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17836">6</sup> For to us a
child is born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to us a son is given,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the government will be on his shoulders.<br>
And he will be called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful Counselor,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17836b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Mighty God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17837">7</sup> Of the increase
of his government and peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be no end.<br>
He will reign on David’s throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and over his kingdom,<br>
establishing and upholding it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with justice and righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from that time on and forever.<br>
The zeal of the LORD Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will accomplish this.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Anger Against Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17838">8</sup> The Lord
has sent a message against Jacob;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will fall on Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17839">9</sup> All the people
will know it—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria—<br>
who say with pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and arrogance of heart,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17840">10</sup> “The bricks
have fallen down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we will rebuild with dressed stone;<br>
the fig trees have been felled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we will replace them with cedars.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17841">11</sup> But the LORD
has strengthened Rezin’s foes against them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has spurred their enemies on.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17842">12</sup> Arameans from
the east and Philistines from the west<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have devoured Israel with open mouth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for all this, his anger is not turned
away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand is still upraised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17843">13</sup> But
the people have not returned to him who struck them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor have they sought the LORD Almighty.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17844">14</sup> So the LORD
will cut off from Israel both head and tail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both palm branch and reed in a single day;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17845">15</sup> the elders and
prominent men are the head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prophets who teach lies are the tail.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17846">16</sup> Those who
guide this people mislead them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who are guided are led astray.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17847">17</sup> Therefore the
Lord will take no pleasure in the young men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will he pity the fatherless and widows,<br>
for everyone is ungodly and wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every mouth speaks vileness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for all this, his anger is not turned
away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand is still upraised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17848">18</sup>
Surely wickedness burns like a fire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it consumes briers and thorns,<br>
it sets the forest thickets ablaze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17849">19</sup> By the wrath
of the LORD Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land will be scorched<br>
and the people will be fuel for the fire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will spare his brother.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17850">20</sup> On the right
they will devour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still be hungry;<br>
on the left they will eat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not be satisfied.<br>
Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring<sup class=

&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17851">21</sup> Manasseh
will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together they will turn against Judah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for all this, his anger is not turned
away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand is still upraised.</p>
