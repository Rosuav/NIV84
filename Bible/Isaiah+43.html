<h5 class="passage-header">Israel’s Only Savior</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18507">1</sup> But now,
this is what the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who created you, O Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who formed you, O Israel:<br>
“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have summoned you by name; you are mine.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18508">2</sup> When you pass
through the waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be with you;<br>
and when you pass through the rivers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will not sweep over you.<br>
When you walk through the fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will not be burned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flames will not set you ablaze.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18509">3</sup> For I am the
LORD, your God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;<br>
I give Egypt for your ransom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cush<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18509a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and
Seba in your stead.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18510">4</sup> Since you are
precious and honored in my sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and because I love you,<br>
I will give men in exchange for you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and people in exchange for your life.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18511">5</sup> Do not be
afraid, for I am with you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring your children from the east<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gather you from the west.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18512">6</sup> I will say to
the north, ‘Give them up!’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’<br>
Bring my sons from afar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my daughters from the ends of the earth—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18513">7</sup> everyone who is
called by my name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I created for my glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I formed and made.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18514">8</sup> Lead
out those who have eyes but are blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have ears but are deaf.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18515">9</sup> All the nations
gather together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples assemble.<br>
Which of them foretold this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and proclaimed to us the former things?<br>
Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that others may hear and say, “It is
true.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18516">10</sup> “You are my
witnesses,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“and my servant whom I have chosen,<br>
so that you may know and believe me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and understand that I am he.<br>
Before me no god was formed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will there be one after me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18517">11</sup> I, even I, am
the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and apart from me there is no savior.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18518">12</sup> I have
revealed and saved and proclaimed—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, and not some foreign god among you.<br>
You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “that I am God.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18519">13</sup> Yes, and
from ancient days I am he.<br>
No one can deliver out of my hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I act, who can reverse it?”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Mercy and Israel’s
Unfaithfulness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18520">14</sup> This is
what the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:<br>
“For your sake I will send to Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring down as fugitives all the
Babylonians,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18520b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the ships in which they took pride.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18521">15</sup> I am the LORD,
your Holy One,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s Creator, your King.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18522">16</sup> This
is what the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who made a way through the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a path through the mighty waters,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18523">17</sup> who drew out
the chariots and horses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the army and reinforcements together,<br>
and they lay there, never to rise again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18524">18</sup> “Forget the
former things;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not dwell on the past.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18525">19</sup> See, I am
doing a new thing!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?<br>
I am making a way in the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams in the wasteland.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18526">20</sup> The wild
animals honor me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the jackals and the owls,<br>
because I provide water in the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams in the wasteland,<br>
to give drink to my people, my chosen,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18527">21</sup> the
people I formed for myself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they may proclaim my praise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18528">22</sup> “Yet
you have not called upon me, O Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have not wearied yourselves for me, O
Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18529">23</sup> You have not
brought me sheep for burnt offerings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor honored me with your sacrifices.<br>
I have not burdened you with grain offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor wearied you with demands for incense.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18530">24</sup> You have not
bought any fragrant calamus for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices.<br>
But you have burdened me with your sins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wearied me with your offenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18531">25</sup> “I,
even I, am he who blots out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your transgressions, for my own sake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and remembers your sins no more.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18532">26</sup> Review the
past for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us argue the matter together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state the case for your innocence.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18533">27</sup> Your first
father sinned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your spokesmen rebelled against me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18534">28</sup> So I will
disgrace the dignitaries of your temple,<br>

destruction<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18534c"
