<h4>Deuteronomy 25</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5549">1</sup> When
men have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges
will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the
guilty. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5550">2</sup> If the
guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make him lie down
and have him flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his
crime deserves, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5551">3</sup>
but he must not give him more than forty lashes. If he is flogged
more than that, your brother will be degraded in your eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5552">4</sup> Do not
muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5553">5</sup> If
brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son,
his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother
shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a
brother-in-law to her. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5554">6</sup> The first son she bears shall carry on
the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted
out from Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5555">7</sup>
However, if a man does not want to marry his brother’s wife, she
shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s
brother refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He will
not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5556">8</sup> Then the elders of his town
shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, “I do
not want to marry her,” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5557">9</sup> his brother’s widow shall go up to him in
the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in
his face and say, “This is what is done to the man who will not
build up his brother’s family line.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5558">10</sup> That man’s line shall be known in Israel
as The Family of the Unsandaled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5559">11</sup> If two
men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her
husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by
his private parts, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5560">12</sup> you shall cut off her hand. Show her no
pity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5561">13</sup> Do not
have two differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5562">14</sup> Do not have two
differing measures in your house—one large, one small. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5563">15</sup> You must have accurate and
honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land
the LORD your God is giving you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5564">16</sup> For the LORD your God detests anyone who
does these things, anyone who deals dishonestly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5565">17</sup>
Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came
out of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5566">18</sup>
When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and
cut off all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5567">19</sup> When the LORD
your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land
he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out
the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!</p>
