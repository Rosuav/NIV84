<h5 class="passage-header">Cleansing From Sin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23061">1</sup> “On that
day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23062">2</sup> “On
that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and
they will be remembered no more,” declares the LORD Almighty. “I
will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the
land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23063">3</sup> And if
anyone still prophesies, his father and mother, to whom he was
born, will say to him, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in
the LORD’s name.’ When he prophesies, his own parents will stab
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23064">4</sup> “On
that day every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision. He
will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23065">5</sup> He will say, ‘I
am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood
since my youth.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23065a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23066">6</sup> If someone asks him, ‘What are these
wounds on your body<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23066b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?’ he will
answer, ‘The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.’</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep
Scattered</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23067">7</sup> “Awake, O
sword, against my shepherd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the man who is close to me!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD Almighty.<br>
“Strike the shepherd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sheep will be scattered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will turn my hand against the little
ones.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23068">8</sup> In the whole
land,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“two-thirds will be struck down and perish;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet one-third will be left in it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23069">9</sup> This third I
will bring into the fire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refine them like silver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and test them like gold.<br>
They will call on my name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will answer them;<br>
I will say, ‘They are my people,’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will say, ‘The LORD is our God.’”
