<h4>1 Samuel 10</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7420">1</sup> Then
Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed
him, saying, “Has not the LORD anointed you leader over his
inheritance?<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7420a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7421">2</sup> When you leave me today, you will meet
two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.
They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have
been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and
is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my
son?”’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7422">3</sup> “Then
you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor.
Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will
be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and
another a skin of wine. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7423">4</sup> They will greet you and offer you two
loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7424">5</sup> “After
that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine
outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of
prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines,
flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be
prophesying. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7425">6</sup> The
Spirit of the LORD will come upon you in power, and you will
prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different
person. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7426">7</sup> Once
these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for
God is with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7427">8</sup> “Go
down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to
sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7427b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> but you must wait seven days until
I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul Made King</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7428">9</sup> As Saul
turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these
signs were fulfilled that day. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7429">10</sup> When they arrived at Gibeah, a
procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in
power, and he joined in their prophesying. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7430">11</sup> When all those who had formerly known
him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other,
“What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also
among the prophets?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7431">12</sup> A man
who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a
saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7432">13</sup> After Saul stopped prophesying, he
went to the high place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7433">14</sup> Now
Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when
we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7434">15</sup> Saul’s
uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7435">16</sup> Saul
replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he
did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7436">17</sup> Samuel
summoned the people of Israel to the LORD at Mizpah <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7437">18</sup> and said to them, “This is
what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of
Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the
kingdoms that oppressed you.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7438">19</sup> But you have now rejected your God, who
saves you out of all your calamities and distresses. And you have
said, ‘No, set a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before
the LORD by your tribes and clans.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7439">20</sup> When
Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin
was chosen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7440">21</sup>
Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and
Matri’s clan was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish was chosen. But
when they looked for him, he was not to be found. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7441">22</sup> So they inquired further
of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the LORD said, “Yes, he has hidden himself
among the baggage.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7442">23</sup> They
ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a
head taller than any of the others. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7443">24</sup> Samuel said to all the people, “Do you
see the man the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all
the people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the people shouted, “Long live the
king!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7444">25</sup> Samuel
explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote
them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel
dismissed the people, each to his own home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7445">26</sup> Saul
also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose
hearts God had touched. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7446">27</sup> But some troublemakers said, “How can
this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts.
But Saul kept silent.</p>
