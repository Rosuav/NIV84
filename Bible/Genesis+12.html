<h4>Genesis 12</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Call of Abram</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-300">1</sup> The LORD
had said to Abram, “Leave your country, your people and your
father’s household and go to the land I will show you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-301">2</sup> “I will
make you into a great nation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will bless you;<br>
I will make your name great,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will be a blessing.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-302">3</sup> I will bless
those who bless you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whoever curses you I will curse;<br>
and all peoples on earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be blessed through you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-303">4</sup> So Abram
left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was
seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-304">5</sup> He took his wife Sarai, his
nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people
they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of
Canaan, and they arrived there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-305">6</sup> Abram
traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of
Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-306">7</sup> The LORD appeared
to Abram and said, “To your offspring<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-306a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> I will give this land.” So he
built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-307">8</sup> From
there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his
tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an
altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-308">9</sup> Then Abram set out and
continued toward the Negev.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Abram in Egypt</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-309">10</sup> Now there
was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live
there for a while because the famine was severe. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-310">11</sup> As he was about to enter
Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman
you are. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-311">12</sup> When
the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they
will kill me but will let you live. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-312">13</sup> Say you are my sister, so that I will be
treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of
you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-313">14</sup> When
Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very
beautiful woman. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-314">15</sup>
And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh,
and she was taken into his palace. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-315">16</sup> He treated Abram well for her sake, and
Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys,
menservants and maidservants, and camels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-316">17</sup> But the
LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household
because of Abram’s wife Sarai. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-317">18</sup> So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you
done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-318">19</sup> Why did you say,
‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then,
here is your wife. Take her and go!” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-319">20</sup> Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to
his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything
he had.</p>
