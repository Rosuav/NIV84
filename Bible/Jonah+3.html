<h5 class="passage-header">Jonah Goes to Nineveh</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22560">1</sup> Then the
word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-22561">2</sup> “Go to the great city of Nineveh and
proclaim to it the message I give you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22562">3</sup> Jonah
obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a
very important city—a visit required three days. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22563">4</sup> On the first day, Jonah
started into the city. He proclaimed: “Forty more days and Nineveh
will be overturned.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22564">5</sup> The Ninevites believed God. They
declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least,
put on sackcloth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22565">6</sup> When
the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took
off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in
the dust. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22566">7</sup> Then
he issued a proclamation in Nineveh:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“By the decree of the king and his nobles:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock,
taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-22567">8</sup> But let man and beast be covered with
sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up
their evil ways and their violence. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22568">9</sup> Who knows? God may yet relent and with
compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not
perish.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22569">10</sup> When
God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he
had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had
threatened.</p>
