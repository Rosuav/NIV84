<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24259">1</sup> A few
days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard
that he had come home. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24260">2</sup> So many gathered that there was no room
left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24261">3</sup> Some men came,
bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24262">4</sup> Since they could not get
him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof
above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the
paralyzed man was lying on. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24263">5</sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he said to
the paralytic, <font class='woj'>“Son, your sins are
forgiven.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24264">6</sup> Now
some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to
themselves, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24265">7</sup>
“Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can
forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24266">8</sup>
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were
thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, <font class=
'woj'>“Why are you thinking these things?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24267">9</sup> Which is
easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to
say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24268">10</sup> But that
you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins…”</font> He said to the paralytic, <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24269">11</sup> “I tell
you, get up, take your mat and go home.”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24270">12</sup> He got up, took his mat
and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and
they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like
this!”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Calling of Levi</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24271">13</sup> Once
again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him,
and he began to teach them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24272">14</sup> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of
Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. <font class=
'woj'>“Follow me,”</font> Jesus told him, and Levi got up and
followed him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24273">15</sup> While
Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and
“sinners” were eating with him and his disciples, for there were
many who followed him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24274">16</sup> When the teachers of the law who were
Pharisees saw him eating with the “sinners” and tax collectors,
they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and
‘sinners’?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24275">17</sup> On
hearing this, Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“It is not the
healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call
the righteous, but sinners.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24276">18</sup> Now
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came
and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples
of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24277">19</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“How can the guests of the bridegroom
fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him
with them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24278">20</sup> But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will
fast.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24279">21</sup> “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth
on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from
the old, making the tear worse.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24280">22</sup> And no
one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will
burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be
ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Lord of the Sabbath</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24281">23</sup> One
Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his
disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24282">24</sup> The Pharisees
said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the
Sabbath?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24283">25</sup> He
answered, <font class='woj'>“Have you never read what David did
when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24284">26</sup> In the days of Abiathar the high
priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread,
which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to
his companions.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24285">27</sup> Then
he said to them, <font class='woj'>“The Sabbath was made for man,
not man for the Sabbath.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24286">28</sup> So the Son of Man is Lord
even of the Sabbath.”</font></p>
