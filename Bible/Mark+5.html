Man</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24363">1</sup> They went
across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24363a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24364">2</sup> When Jesus got out of the boat, a man
with an evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24364b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> spirit came from the tombs to
meet him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24365">3</sup> This
man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not
even with a chain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24366">4</sup> For he had often been chained hand and
foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet.
No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24367">5</sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the
hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24368">6</sup> When
he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front
of him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24369">7</sup> He
shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus,
Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won’t torture me!”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24370">8</sup> For Jesus had
said to him, <font class='woj'>“Come out of this man, you evil
spirit!”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24371">9</sup> Then
Jesus asked him, <font class='woj'>“What is your name?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are
many.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24372">10</sup> And he
begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24373">11</sup> A
large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24374">12</sup> The demons begged Jesus,
“Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24375">13</sup> He gave them permission,
and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd,
about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the
lake and were drowned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24376">14</sup> Those
tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and
countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24377">15</sup> When they came
to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of
demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were
afraid. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24378">16</sup> Those
who had seen it told the people what had happened to the
demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24379">17</sup> Then the people began to
plead with Jesus to leave their region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24380">18</sup> As
Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been
demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24381">19</sup> Jesus did not let him, but said,
<font class='woj'>“Go home to your family and tell them how much
the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24382">20</sup> So the man
went away and began to tell in the Decapolis<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24382c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> how much Jesus had done for him. And
all the people were amazed.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24383">21</sup> When
Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake,
a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24384">22</sup> Then one of
the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he
fell at his feet <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24385">23</sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, “My
little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so
that she will be healed and live.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24386">24</sup> So Jesus went with him.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24387">25</sup> And a woman
was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24388">26</sup> She had
suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent
all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24389">27</sup> When she heard
about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his
cloak, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24390">28</sup> because
she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24391">29</sup> Immediately
her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed
from her suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24392">30</sup> At
once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned
around in the crowd and asked, <font class='woj'>“Who touched my
clothes?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24393">31</sup> “You
see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and
yet you can ask, <font class='woj'>‘Who touched me?’</font> ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24394">32</sup> But
Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24395">33</sup> Then the woman, knowing
what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling
with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24396">34</sup> He said to her, <font class=
'woj'>“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be
freed from your suffering.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24397">35</sup> While
Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus,
the synagogue ruler. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why
bother the teacher any more?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24398">36</sup>
Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler,
<font class='woj'>“Don’t be afraid; just believe.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24399">37</sup> He
did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the
brother of James. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24400">38</sup> When they came to the home of the
synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and
wailing loudly. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24401">39</sup> He went in and said to them,
<font class='woj'>“Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is
not dead but asleep.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24402">40</sup> But they laughed at him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he put them all out, he took the child’s
father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in
where the child was. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24403">41</sup> He took her by the hand and said to
her, <font class='woj'><i>“Talitha koum!”</i></font> (which means,
<font class='woj'>“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”</font>).
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24404">42</sup> Immediately
the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At
this they were completely astonished. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24405">43</sup> He gave strict orders not to let anyone
know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>
