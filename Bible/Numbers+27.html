<h4>Numbers 27</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Zelophehad’s Daughters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4556">1</sup> The
daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh
son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah,
Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. They approached <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4557">2</sup> the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the
whole assembly, and said, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4558">3</sup> “Our father died in the desert. He was
not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the LORD,
but he died for his own sin and left no sons. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4559">4</sup> Why should our father’s name disappear
from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our
father’s relatives.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4560">5</sup> So
Moses brought their case before the LORD <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4561">6</sup> and the LORD said to him, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4562">7</sup> “What Zelophehad’s
daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them
property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and turn
their father’s inheritance over to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4563">8</sup> “Say to
the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, turn his
inheritance over to his daughter. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4564">9</sup> If he has no daughter, give his
inheritance to his brothers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4565">10</sup> If he has no brothers, give his
inheritance to his father’s brothers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4566">11</sup> If his father had no brothers, give his
inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may
possess it. This is to be a legal requirement for the Israelites,
as the LORD commanded Moses.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joshua to Succeed Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4567">12</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim range and
see the land I have given the Israelites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4568">13</sup> After you have seen it, you too will be
gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4569">14</sup> for when the community
rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed
my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.” (These were the
waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4570">15</sup> Moses
said to the LORD, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4571">16</sup> “May the LORD, the God of the spirits of
all mankind, appoint a man over this community <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4572">17</sup> to go out and come in
before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the
LORD’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4573">18</sup> So the
LORD said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the
spirit,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4573a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and lay your hand on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4574">19</sup> Have him stand
before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission
him in their presence. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4575">20</sup> Give him some of your authority so the
whole Israelite community will obey him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4576">21</sup> He is to stand before Eleazar the
priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim
before the LORD. At his command he and the entire community of the
Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4577">22</sup> Moses
did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand
before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4578">23</sup> Then he laid his hands on
him and commissioned him, as the LORD instructed through Moses.</p>
