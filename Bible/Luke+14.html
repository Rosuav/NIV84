<h4>Luke 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus at a Pharisee’s House</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25547">1</sup> One
Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent
Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25548">2</sup> There in front of him was a man
suffering from dropsy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25549">3</sup> Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in
the law, <font class='woj'>“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or
not?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25550">4</sup>
But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him
and sent him away.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25551">5</sup> Then
he asked them, <font class='woj'>“If one of you has a
son<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25551a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> or an ox that falls into a well on
the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25552">6</sup> And they had
nothing to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25553">7</sup> When
he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table,
he told them this parable: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25554">8</sup> “When someone invites you to a
wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more
distinguished than you may have been invited.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25555">9</sup> If so,
the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give
this man your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the
least important place.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25556">10</sup> But when you are invited,
take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to
you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored
in the presence of all your fellow guests.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25557">11</sup> For
everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles
himself will be exalted.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25558">12</sup> Then
Jesus said to his host, <font class='woj'>“When you give a luncheon
or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives,
or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so
you will be repaid.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25559">13</sup> But when you give a banquet, invite
the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25560">14</sup> and you
will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid
at the resurrection of the righteous.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Great Banquet</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25561">15</sup> When one
of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus,
“Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of
God.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25562">16</sup> Jesus
replied: <font class='woj'>“A certain man was preparing a great
banquet and invited many guests.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25563">17</sup> At the
time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been
invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25564">18</sup> “But they all alike began to make
excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go
and see it. Please excuse me.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25565">19</sup> “Another said, ‘I have just bought five
yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse
me.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25566">20</sup> “Still another said, ‘I just got
married, so I can’t come.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25567">21</sup> “The servant came back and reported
this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and
ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of
the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the
lame.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25568">22</sup> “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you
ordered has been done, but there is still room.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25569">23</sup> “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go
out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that
my house will be full.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25570">24</sup> I tell you, not one of
those men who were invited will get a taste of my
banquet.’”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Cost of Being a Disciple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25571">25</sup> Large
crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25572">26</sup> “If anyone comes to me and does not
hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and
sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be my disciple.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25573">27</sup> And anyone who does not carry his cross
and follow me cannot be my disciple.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25574">28</sup> “Suppose one of you wants to build a
tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if
he has enough money to complete it?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25575">29</sup> For if
he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who
sees it will ridicule him,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25576">30</sup> saying, ‘This fellow
began to build and was not able to finish.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25577">31</sup> “Or suppose a king is about to go to
war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider
whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming
against him with twenty thousand?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25578">32</sup> If he is
not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long
way off and will ask for terms of peace.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25579">33</sup> In the
same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot
be my disciple.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25580">34</sup> “Salt is good, but if it loses its
saltiness, how can it be made salty again?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25581">35</sup> It is
fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown
out.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“He who has ears to hear,
let him hear.”</font></p>
