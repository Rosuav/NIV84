<h4>Jeremiah 15</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19317">1</sup> Then
the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before
me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from
my presence! Let them go! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19318">2</sup> And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we
go?’ tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Those destined for death, to death;<br>
those for the sword, to the sword;<br>
those for starvation, to starvation;<br>
those for captivity, to captivity.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19319">3</sup> “I
will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” declares the
LORD, “the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds of
the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19320">4</sup> I will make
them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what
Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19321">5</sup> “Who
will have pity on you, O Jerusalem?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will mourn for you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will stop to ask how you are?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19322">6</sup> You have
rejected me,” declares the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You keep on backsliding.<br>
So I will lay hands on you and destroy you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can no longer show compassion.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19323">7</sup> I will winnow
them with a winnowing fork<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the city gates of the land.<br>
I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have not changed their ways.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19324">8</sup> I will make
their widows more numerous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the sand of the sea.<br>
At midday I will bring a destroyer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the mothers of their young men;<br>
suddenly I will bring down on them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anguish and terror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19325">9</sup> The mother of
seven will grow faint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and breathe her last.<br>
Her sun will set while it is still day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will be disgraced and humiliated.<br>
I will put the survivors to the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before their enemies,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19326">10</sup> Alas,
my mother, that you gave me birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man with whom the whole land strives and
contends!<br>
I have neither lent nor borrowed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet everyone curses me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19327">11</sup> The
LORD said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Surely I will deliver you for a good
purpose;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely I will make your enemies plead with
you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in times of disaster and times of distress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19328">12</sup> “Can
a man break iron—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iron from the north—or bronze?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19329">13</sup> Your wealth
and your treasures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give as plunder, without charge,<br>
because of all your sins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout your country.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19330">14</sup> I will enslave
you to your enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19330a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> a land
you do not know,<br>
for my anger will kindle a fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will burn against you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19331">15</sup> You
understand, O LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remember me and care for me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avenge me on my persecutors.<br>
You are long-suffering—do not take me away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19332">16</sup> When your
words came, I ate them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were my joy and my heart’s delight,<br>
for I bear your name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O LORD God Almighty.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19333">17</sup> I never sat in
the company of revelers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never made merry with them;<br>
I sat alone because your hand was on me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you had filled me with indignation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19334">18</sup> Why is my pain
unending<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my wound grievous and incurable?<br>
Will you be to me like a deceptive brook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a spring that fails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19335">19</sup>
Therefore this is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you repent, I will restore you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you may serve me;<br>
if you utter worthy, not worthless, words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be my spokesman.<br>
Let this people turn to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you must not turn to them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19336">20</sup> I will make
you a wall to this people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fortified wall of bronze;<br>
they will fight against you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but will not overcome you,<br>
for I am with you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to rescue and save you,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19337">21</sup> “I will save
you from the hands of the wicked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel.”</p>
