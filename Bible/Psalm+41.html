<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14544">1</sup>
Blessed is he who has regard for the weak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD delivers him in times of trouble.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14545">2</sup> The LORD will
protect him and preserve his life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will bless him in the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not surrender him to the desire of his
foes.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14546">3</sup> The LORD will
sustain him on his sickbed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and restore him from his bed of illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14547">4</sup> I
said, “O LORD, have mercy on me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heal me, for I have sinned against you.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14548">5</sup> My enemies say
of me in malice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When will he die and his name perish?”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14549">6</sup> Whenever one
comes to see me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers
slander;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then he goes out and spreads it abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14550">7</sup> All my
enemies whisper together against me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they imagine the worst for me, saying,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14551">8</sup> “A vile disease
has beset him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will never get up from the place where he
lies.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14552">9</sup> Even my close
friend, whom I trusted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who shared my bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has lifted up his heel against me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14553">10</sup> But
you, O LORD, have mercy on me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raise me up, that I may repay them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14554">11</sup> I know that
you are pleased with me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my enemy does not triumph over me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14555">12</sup> In my
integrity you uphold me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set me in your presence forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-14556">13</sup> Praise be to
the LORD, the God of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from everlasting to everlasting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen
and Amen.</p>
