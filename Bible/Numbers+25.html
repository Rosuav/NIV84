<h4>Numbers 25</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Moab Seduces Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4473">1</sup> While
Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual
immorality with Moabite women, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4474">2</sup> who invited them to the sacrifices to
their gods. The people ate and bowed down before these gods.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4475">3</sup> So Israel joined
in worshiping the Baal of Peor. And the LORD’s anger burned against
them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4476">4</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill
them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the
LORD’s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4477">5</sup> So
Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those
of your men who have joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4478">6</sup> Then an
Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman right before
the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were
weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4479">7</sup> When Phinehas son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the
assembly, took a spear in his hand <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4480">8</sup> and followed the Israelite into the tent.
He drove the spear through both of them—through the Israelite and
into the woman’s body. Then the plague against the Israelites was
stopped; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4481">9</sup> but
those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4482">10</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4483">11</sup> “Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of
Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites;
for he was as zealous as I am for my honor among them, so that in
my zeal I did not put an end to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4484">12</sup> Therefore tell him I am making my
covenant of peace with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4485">13</sup> He and his descendants will have a
covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the
honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4486">14</sup> The
name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was
Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4487">15</sup> And the name of the
Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a
tribal chief of a Midianite family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4488">16</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4489">17</sup> “Treat the Midianites as enemies and
kill them, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4490">18</sup>
because they treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the
affair of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite
leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result
of Peor.”</p>
