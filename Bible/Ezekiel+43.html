<h4>Ezekiel 43</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Glory Returns to the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21574">1</sup> Then the
man brought me to the gate facing east, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21575">2</sup> and I saw the glory of the God of Israel
coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing
waters, and the land was radiant with his glory. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21576">3</sup> The vision I saw was like
the vision I had seen when he<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21576a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> came to
destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar
River, and I fell facedown. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21577">4</sup> The glory of the LORD entered the temple
through the gate facing east. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21578">5</sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought
me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the
temple.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21579">6</sup> While
the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from
inside the temple. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21580">7</sup> He said: “Son of man, this is the place
of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where
I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will
never again defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by
their prostitution<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21580b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and the
lifeless idols<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21580c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> of their kings at their high
places. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21581">8</sup> When
they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their
doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and
them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I
destroyed them in my anger. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21582">9</sup> Now let them put away from me their
prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings, and I will live
among them forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21583">10</sup> “Son
of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may
be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider the plan, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21584">11</sup> and if they are ashamed
of all they have done, make known to them the design of the
temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design
and all its regulations<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21584d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and laws.
Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its
design and follow all its regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21585">12</sup> “This
is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the
mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Altar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21586">13</sup> “These
are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being
a cubit<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21586e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and a handbreadth<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21586f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a
cubit wide, with a rim of one span<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21586g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> around
the edge. And this is the height of the altar: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21587">14</sup> From the gutter on the
ground up to the lower ledge it is two cubits high and a cubit
wide, and from the smaller ledge up to the larger ledge it is four
cubits high and a cubit wide. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21588">15</sup> The altar hearth is four cubits high,
and four horns project upward from the hearth. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21589">16</sup> The altar hearth is
square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21590">17</sup> The upper ledge also is
square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim
of half a cubit and a gutter of a cubit all around. The steps of
the altar face east.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21591">18</sup> Then
he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and
sprinkling blood upon the altar when it is built: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21592">19</sup> You are to give a young
bull as a sin offering to the priests, who are Levites, of the
family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the
Sovereign LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21593">20</sup> You are to take some of its blood and
put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of
the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and
make atonement for it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21594">21</sup> You are to take the bull for the sin
offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area
outside the sanctuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21595">22</sup> “On
the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a
sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified
with the bull. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21596">23</sup>
When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull
and a ram from the flock, both without defect. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21597">24</sup> You are to offer them
before the LORD, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and
sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21598">25</sup> “For
seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering;
you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both
without defect. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21599">26</sup> For seven days they are to make
atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21600">27</sup> At the end of
these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21600h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> on the altar. Then I will accept you,
declares the Sovereign LORD.”</p>
