&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25453">1</sup>
Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that
they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to
his disciples, saying: <font class='woj'>“Be on your guard against
the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25454">2</sup> There is
nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will
not be made known.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25455">3</sup> What you have said in the dark will
be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in
the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25456">4</sup> “I tell you, my friends, do not be
afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no
more.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25457">5</sup> But I will show you whom you should
fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to
throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25458">6</sup> Are not
five sparrows sold for two pennies<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25458a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>? Yet not
one of them is forgotten by God.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25459">7</sup> Indeed,
the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you
are worth more than many sparrows.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25460">8</sup> “I tell you, whoever acknowledges me
before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the
angels of God.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25461">9</sup> But he who disowns me before men will be
disowned before the angels of God.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25462">10</sup> And
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven,
but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be
forgiven.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25463">11</sup> “When you are brought before
synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will
defend yourselves or what you will say,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25464">12</sup> for the
Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should
say.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Rich Fool</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25465">13</sup> Someone
in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the
inheritance with me.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25466">14</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Man, who appointed me a judge or an
arbiter between you?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25467">15</sup> Then he said to them, <font class=
'woj'>“Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a
man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his
possessions.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25468">16</sup> And
he told them this parable: <font class='woj'>“The ground of a
certain rich man produced a good crop.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25469">17</sup> He
thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my
crops.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25470">18</sup> “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I
will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will
store all my grain and my goods.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25471">19</sup> And I’ll
say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many
years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25472">20</sup> “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This
very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get
what you have prepared for yourself?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25473">21</sup> “This is how it will be with anyone who
stores up things for himself but is not rich toward
God.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Do Not Worry</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25474">22</sup> Then
Jesus said to his disciples: <font class='woj'>“Therefore I tell
you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your
body, what you will wear.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25475">23</sup> Life is more than food,
and the body more than clothes.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25476">24</sup> Consider
the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or
barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than
birds!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25477">25</sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single
hour to his life<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25477b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25478">26</sup> Since you cannot do this very little
thing, why do you worry about the rest?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25479">27</sup> “Consider how the lilies grow. They do
not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his
splendor was dressed like one of these.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25480">28</sup> If that
is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you,
O you of little faith!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25481">29</sup> And do not set your heart
on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25482">30</sup> For the pagan world runs after all such
things, and your Father knows that you need them.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25483">31</sup> But seek his kingdom, and these things
will be given to you as well.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25484">32</sup> “Do not be afraid, little flock, for
your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25485">33</sup> Sell your possessions and give to the
poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a
treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes
near and no moth destroys.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25486">34</sup> For where your treasure
is, there your heart will be also.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Watchfulness</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25487">35</sup> “Be dressed ready for service and keep
your lamps burning,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25488">36</sup> like men waiting for their master to
return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks
they can immediately open the door for him.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25489">37</sup> It will
be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he
comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will
have them recline at the table and will come and wait on
them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25490">38</sup> It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or
third watch of the night.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25491">39</sup> But understand this: If
the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming,
he would not have let his house be broken into.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25492">40</sup> You also
must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you
do not expect him.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25493">41</sup> Peter
asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to
everyone?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25494">42</sup> The
Lord answered, <font class='woj'>“Who then is the faithful and wise
manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give
them their food allowance at the proper time?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25495">43</sup> It will
be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he
returns.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25496">44</sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him
in charge of all his possessions.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25497">45</sup> But
suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long
time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the menservants and
maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25498">46</sup> The master of that servant will come on
a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware
of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the
unbelievers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25499">47</sup> “That servant who knows his master’s
will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants
will be beaten with many blows.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25500">48</sup> But the
one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be
beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much
will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with
much, much more will be asked.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Not Peace but Division</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25501">49</sup> “I have come to bring fire on the
earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25502">50</sup> But I
have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is
completed!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25503">51</sup> Do you think I came to bring peace on
earth? No, I tell you, but division.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25504">52</sup> From now
on there will be five in one family divided against each other,
three against two and two against three.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25505">53</sup> They
will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother
against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against
daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">Interpreting the Times</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25506">54</sup> He said
to the crowd: <font class='woj'>“When you see a cloud rising in the
west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it
does.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25507">55</sup> And when the south wind blows, you say,
‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25508">56</sup>
Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth
and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this
present time?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25509">57</sup> “Why don’t you judge for yourselves
what is right?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25510">58</sup> As you are going with your adversary to
the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled to him on the way, or he
may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the
officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25511">59</sup> I tell
you, you will not get out until you have paid the last
penny.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25511c" title=
