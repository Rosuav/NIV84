<h5 class="passage-header">Discharges Causing Uncleanness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3170">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses and Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3171">2</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and say to them:
‘When any man has a bodily discharge, the discharge is unclean.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3172">3</sup> Whether it
continues flowing from his body or is blocked, it will make him
unclean. This is how his discharge will bring about uncleanness:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3173">4</sup> “‘Any
bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and anything
he sits on will be unclean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3174">5</sup> Anyone who touches his bed must wash his
clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3175">6</sup> Whoever sits on
anything that the man with a discharge sat on must wash his clothes
and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3176">7</sup>
“‘Whoever touches the man who has a discharge must wash his clothes
and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3177">8</sup> “‘If
the man with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, that
person must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be
unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3178">9</sup>
“‘Everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3179">10</sup> and whoever
touches any of the things that were under him will be unclean till
evening; whoever picks up those things must wash his clothes and
bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3180">11</sup>
“‘Anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands
with water must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will
be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3181">12</sup> “‘A
clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden
article is to be rinsed with water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3182">13</sup> “‘When
a man is cleansed from his discharge, he is to count off seven days
for his ceremonial cleansing; he must wash his clothes and bathe
himself with fresh water, and he will be clean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3183">14</sup> On the eighth day he must
take two doves or two young pigeons and come before the LORD to the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3184">15</sup> The priest is
to sacrifice them, the one for a sin offering and the other for a
burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement before the LORD
for the man because of his discharge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3185">16</sup> “‘When
a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with
water, and he will be unclean till evening. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3186">17</sup> Any clothing or leather that has
semen on it must be washed with water, and it will be unclean till
evening. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3187">18</sup> When a
man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both must
bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3188">19</sup> “‘When
a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly
period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be
unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3189">20</sup>
“‘Anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and
anything she sits on will be unclean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3190">21</sup> Whoever touches her bed must wash his
clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3191">22</sup> Whoever touches
anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water,
and he will be unclean till evening. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3192">23</sup> Whether it is the bed or anything she
was sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till
evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3193">24</sup> “‘If a
man lies with her and her monthly flow touches him, he will be
unclean for seven days; any bed he lies on will be unclean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3194">25</sup> “‘When
a woman has a discharge of blood for many days at a time other than
her monthly period or has a discharge that continues beyond her
period, she will be unclean as long as she has the discharge, just
as in the days of her period. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3195">26</sup> Any bed she lies on while her discharge
continues will be unclean, as is her bed during her monthly period,
and anything she sits on will be unclean, as during her period.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3196">27</sup> Whoever touches
them will be unclean; he must wash his clothes and bathe with
water, and he will be unclean till evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3197">28</sup> “‘When
she is cleansed from her discharge, she must count off seven days,
and after that she will be ceremonially clean. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3198">29</sup> On the eighth day she must
take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3199">30</sup> The priest is to sacrifice one for a sin
offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will
make atonement for her before the LORD for the uncleanness of her
discharge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3200">31</sup> “‘You
must keep the Israelites separate from things that make them
unclean, so they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my
dwelling place,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3200a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> which is among them.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3201">32</sup> These
are the regulations for a man with a discharge, for anyone made
unclean by an emission of semen, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3202">33</sup> for a woman in her monthly period, for a
man or a woman with a discharge, and for a man who lies with a
woman who is ceremonially unclean.</p>
