<h4>Revelation 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Prologue</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30683">1</sup> The
revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants
what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to
his servant John, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30684">2</sup> who testifies to everything he saw—that
is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30685">3</sup> Blessed is the one who
reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it
and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
<h5 class="passage-header">Greetings and Doxology</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30686">4</sup> John,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the seven churches in the province of
Asia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace and peace to you from him who is, and
who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30686a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> before his throne, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30687">5</sup> and from Jesus Christ, who
is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler
of the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him who loves us and has freed us from our
sins by his blood, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30688">6</sup> and has made us to be a kingdom and
priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for
ever and ever! Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30689">7</sup> Look,
he is coming with the clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every eye will see him,<br>
even those who pierced him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the peoples of the earth will mourn
because of him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
shall it be! Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30690">8</sup> “I am the Alpha and the Omega,”</font>
says the Lord God, <font class='woj'>“who is, and who was, and who
is to come, the Almighty.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">One Like a Son of Man</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30691">9</sup> I, John,
your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient
endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos
because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30692">10</sup> On the Lord’s Day I was
in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30693">11</sup> which said:
<font class='woj'>“Write on a scroll what you see and send it to
the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
Philadelphia and Laodicea.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30694">12</sup> I
turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I
turned I saw seven golden lampstands, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30695">13</sup> and among the lampstands was someone
“like a son of man,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30695b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash
around his chest. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30696">14</sup> His head and hair were white like wool,
as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30697">15</sup> His feet were like bronze
glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing
waters. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30698">16</sup> In his
right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp
double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its
brilliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30699">17</sup> When
I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his
right hand on me and said: <font class='woj'>“Do not be afraid. I
am the First and the Last.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30700">18</sup> I am the Living One; I
was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the
keys of death and Hades.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30701">19</sup> “Write, therefore, what you have seen,
what is now and what will take place later.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30702">20</sup> The
mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the
seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the
angels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30702c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of the seven churches, and the
seven lampstands are the seven churches.</font></p>
