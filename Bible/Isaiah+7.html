<h4>Isaiah 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Sign of Immanuel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17784">1</sup> When Ahaz
son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of
Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight
against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17785">2</sup> Now
the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself
with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17785a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Ephraim”; so the hearts of Ahaz
and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken
by the wind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17786">3</sup> Then
the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son
Shear-Jashub,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17786b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to meet Ahaz at the end of
the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman’s
Field. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17787">4</sup> Say to
him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart
because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the
fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17788">5</sup> Aram, Ephraim
and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17789">6</sup> “Let us invade Judah; let
us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of
Tabeel king over it.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17790">7</sup> Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD
says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘It will not take place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will not happen,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17791">8</sup> for the head of
Aram is Damascus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the head of Damascus is only Rezin.<br>
Within sixty-five years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17792">9</sup> The head of
Ephraim is Samaria,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s
son.<br>
If you do not stand firm in your faith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will not stand at all.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17793">10</sup> Again
the LORD spoke to Ahaz, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17794">11</sup> “Ask the LORD your God for a sign,
whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17795">12</sup> But
Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the
test.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17796">13</sup> Then
Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try
the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17797">14</sup> Therefore the
Lord himself will give you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-17797c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> a
sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son,
and<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17797d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> will call him Immanuel.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17797e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17798">15</sup> He will eat curds and honey when he
knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17799">16</sup> But before the boy knows
enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the
two kings you dread will be laid waste. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17800">17</sup> The LORD will bring on you and on your
people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since
Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of
Assyria.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17801">18</sup> In
that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams
of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17802">19</sup> They will all come and
settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on
all the thornbushes and at all the water holes. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17803">20</sup> In that day the Lord will
use a razor hired from beyond the River<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17803f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup>—the king of Assyria—to shave your
head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17804">21</sup> In that day, a
man will keep alive a young cow and two goats. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17805">22</sup> And because of the
abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who
remain in the land will eat curds and honey. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-17806">23</sup> In that day, in every place where
there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver
shekels,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17806g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> there will be only briers and
thorns. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17807">24</sup> Men
will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with
briers and thorns. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-17808">25</sup> As for all the hills once cultivated by
the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and
thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and
where sheep run.</p>
