<h4>James 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning to Rich Oppressors</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30340">1</sup> Now
listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that
is coming upon you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30341">2</sup> Your wealth has rotted, and moths have
eaten your clothes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30342">3</sup> Your gold and silver are corroded. Their
corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire.
You have hoarded wealth in the last days. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30343">4</sup> Look! The wages you failed to pay the
workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries
of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30344">5</sup> You have lived
on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened
yourselves in the day of slaughter.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30344a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30345">6</sup> You have
condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.
<h5 class="passage-header">Patience in Suffering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30346">7</sup> Be
patient, then, brothers, until the Lord’s coming. See how the
farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how
patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30347">8</sup> You too, be patient and
stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30348">9</sup> Don’t grumble against each
other, brothers, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at
the door!
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30349">10</sup>
Brothers, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take
the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30350">11</sup> As you know, we consider
blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s
perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The
Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30351">12</sup> Above
all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by
anything else. Let your “Yes” be yes, and your “No,” no, or you
will be condemned.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Prayer of Faith</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30352">13</sup> Is any
one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him
sing songs of praise. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30353">14</sup> Is any one of you sick? He should call
the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil
in the name of the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30354">15</sup> And the prayer offered in faith will
make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has
sinned, he will be forgiven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30355">16</sup> Therefore confess your sins to each
other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer
of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30356">17</sup>
Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would
not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half
years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30357">18</sup> Again
he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its
crops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30358">19</sup> My
brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone
should bring him back, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30359">20</sup> remember this: Whoever turns a sinner
from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a
multitude of sins.</p>
