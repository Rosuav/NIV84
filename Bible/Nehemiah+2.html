<h5 class="passage-header">Artaxerxes Sends Nehemiah to
Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12309">1</sup> In the
month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine
was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had
not been sad in his presence before; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12310">2</sup> so the king asked me, “Why does your
face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but
sadness of heart.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very much afraid, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12311">3</sup> but I said to the king, “May the king
live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where
my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been
destroyed by fire?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12312">4</sup> The
king said to me, “What is it you want?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I prayed to the God of heaven,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12313">5</sup> and I answered
the king, “If it pleases the king and if your servant has found
favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my
fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12314">6</sup> Then
the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long
will your journey take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the
king to send me; so I set a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12315">7</sup> I also
said to him, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the
governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me
safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12316">8</sup> And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper
of the king’s forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for
the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and
for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of
my God was upon me, the king granted my requests. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12317">9</sup> So I went to the governors
of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had
also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12318">10</sup> When
Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about
this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to
promote the welfare of the Israelites.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem’s Walls</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12319">11</sup> I went
to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12320">12</sup> I set out during the
night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in
my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except
the one I was riding on.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12321">13</sup> By
night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the
Jackal<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12321a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Well and the Dung Gate, examining
the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates,
which had been destroyed by fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12322">14</sup> Then I moved on toward the Fountain
Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for my
mount to get through; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12323">15</sup> so I went up the valley by night,
examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through
the Valley Gate. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12324">16</sup> The officials did not know where I had
gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the
Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would
be doing the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12325">17</sup> Then
I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in
ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us
rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in
disgrace.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12326">18</sup> I
also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what
the king had said to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So
they began this good work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12327">19</sup> But
when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and
Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What
is this you are doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the
king?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12328">20</sup> I
answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success.
We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no
share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.”</p>
