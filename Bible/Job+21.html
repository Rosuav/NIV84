&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13357">1</sup> Then Job
replied:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13358">2</sup>
“Listen carefully to my words;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let this be the consolation you give me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13359">3</sup> Bear with me
while I speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and after I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13360">4</sup> “Is my
complaint directed to man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I not be impatient?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13361">5</sup> Look at me and
be astonished;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clap your hand over your mouth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13362">6</sup> When I think
about this, I am terrified;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trembling seizes my body.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13363">7</sup> Why do the
wicked live on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growing old and increasing in power?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13364">8</sup> They see their
children established around them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their offspring before their eyes.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13365">9</sup> Their homes are
safe and free from fear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rod of God is not upon them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13366">10</sup> Their bulls
never fail to breed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their cows calve and do not miscarry.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13367">11</sup> They send
forth their children as a flock;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their little ones dance about.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13368">12</sup> They sing to
the music of tambourine and harp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make merry to the sound of the flute.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13369">13</sup> They spend
their years in prosperity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and go down to the grave<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13369a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in peace.<sup class=

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13370">14</sup> Yet they say
to God, ‘Leave us alone!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no desire to know your ways.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13371">15</sup> Who is the
Almighty, that we should serve him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would we gain by praying to him?’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13372">16</sup> But their
prosperity is not in their own hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I stand aloof from the counsel of the
wicked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13373">17</sup> “Yet
how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often does calamity come upon them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fate God allots in his anger?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13374">18</sup> How often are
they like straw before the wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like chaff swept away by a gale?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13375">19</sup> It is said,
‘God stores up a man’s punishment for his sons.’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him repay the man himself, so that he will
know it!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13376">20</sup> Let his own
eyes see his destruction;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him drink of the wrath of the
Almighty.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13376c"

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13377">21</sup> For what does
he care about the family he leaves behind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when his allotted months come to an end?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13378">22</sup> “Can
anyone teach knowledge to God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since he judges even the highest?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13379">23</sup> One man dies
in full vigor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely secure and at ease,<br>

body<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-13380d" title=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his bones rich with marrow.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13381">25</sup> Another man
dies in bitterness of soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never having enjoyed anything good.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13382">26</sup> Side by side
they lie in the dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and worms cover them both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13383">27</sup> “I
know full well what you are thinking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the schemes by which you would wrong me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13384">28</sup> You say,
‘Where now is the great man’s house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tents where wicked men lived?’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13385">29</sup> Have you never
questioned those who travel?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you paid no regard to their accounts—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-13386">30</sup> that the evil
man is spared from the day of calamity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is delivered from<sup class=

to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and watch is kept over his tomb.<br>
