<h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians’
Faith</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29547">2</sup> We always
thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29548">3</sup> We continually
remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith,
your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in
our Lord Jesus Christ.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29549">4</sup> For we
know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29550">5</sup> because our gospel came to
you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy
Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you
for your sake. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29551">6</sup>
You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe
suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy
Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29552">7</sup> And so
you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29553">8</sup> The Lord’s
message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your
faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need
to say anything about it, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29554">9</sup> for they themselves report what kind of
reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols
to serve the living and true God, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29555">10</sup> and to wait for his Son from heaven,
whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming
wrath.</p>
