<h4>1 Chronicles 24</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Divisions of Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11017">1</sup> These
were the divisions of the sons of Aaron:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar
and Ithamar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11018">2</sup>
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no
sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11019">3</sup> With the help of Zadok a
descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David
separated them into divisions for their appointed order of
ministering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11020">4</sup> A
larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants
than among Ithamar’s, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen
heads of families from Eleazar’s descendants and eight heads of
families from Ithamar’s descendants. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11021">5</sup> They divided them impartially by drawing
lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of
God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11022">6</sup> The
scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in
the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest,
Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests
and of the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar and then one
from Ithamar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11023">7</sup> The
first lot fell to Jehoiarib,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second to Jedaiah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11024">8</sup> the
third to Harim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourth to Seorim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11025">9</sup> the
fifth to Malkijah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sixth to Mijamin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11026">10</sup> the
seventh to Hakkoz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eighth to Abijah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11027">11</sup> the
ninth to Jeshua,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tenth to Shecaniah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11028">12</sup> the
eleventh to Eliashib,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twelfth to Jakim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11029">13</sup> the
thirteenth to Huppah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11030">14</sup> the
fifteenth to Bilgah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sixteenth to Immer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11031">15</sup> the
seventeenth to Hezir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eighteenth to Happizzez,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11032">16</sup> the
nineteenth to Pethahiah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twentieth to Jehezkel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11033">17</sup> the
twenty-first to Jakin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the twenty-second to Gamul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11034">18</sup> the
twenty-third to Delaiah</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11035">19</sup> This
was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the
temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for
them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had
commanded him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Rest of the Levites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11036">20</sup> As for
the rest of the descendants of Levi:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sons of Amram: Shubael;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11037">21</sup> As for
Rehabiah, from his sons:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isshiah was the first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11040">24</sup> The
son of Uzziel: Micah;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sons of Micah: Shamir.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11041">25</sup> The
brother of Micah: Isshiah;<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the Levites, according to their
families. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11047">31</sup> They
also cast lots, just as their brothers the descendants of Aaron
did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the
heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families
of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the
youngest.</p>
