<h4>Genesis 41</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Pharaoh’s Dreams</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1197">1</sup> When two
full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the
Nile, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1198">2</sup> when out
of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they
grazed among the reeds. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1199">3</sup> After them, seven other cows, ugly and
gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the
riverbank. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1200">4</sup> And
the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows.
Then Pharaoh woke up.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1201">5</sup> He fell
asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy
and good, were growing on a single stalk. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1202">6</sup> After them, seven other heads of grain
sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1203">7</sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up
the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a
dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1204">8</sup> In the
morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and
wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could
interpret them for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1205">9</sup> Then
the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my
shortcomings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1206">10</sup>
Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and
the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1207">11</sup> Each of us had
a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1208">12</sup> Now a young
Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We
told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each
man the interpretation of his dream. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1209">13</sup> And things turned out exactly as he
interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the
other man was hanged.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1209a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1210">14</sup> So
Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the
dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before
Pharaoh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1211">15</sup>
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret
it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you
can interpret it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1212">16</sup> “I
cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give
Pharaoh the answer he desires.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1213">17</sup> Then
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of
the Nile, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1214">18</sup> when
out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they
grazed among the reeds. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1215">19</sup> After them, seven other cows came
up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows
in all the land of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1216">20</sup> The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat
cows that came up first. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1217">21</sup> But even after they ate them, no one
could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as
before. Then I woke up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1218">22</sup> “In my
dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a
single stalk. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1219">23</sup>
After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and
scorched by the east wind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1220">24</sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the
seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could
explain it to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1221">25</sup> Then
Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the
same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1222">26</sup> The seven good
cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven
years; it is one and the same dream. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1223">27</sup> The seven lean, ugly cows that came up
afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of
grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of
famine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1224">28</sup> “It is
just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about
to do. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1225">29</sup> Seven
years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1226">30</sup> but seven years
of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be
forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1227">31</sup> The abundance in the land
will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be
so severe. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1228">32</sup> The
reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the
matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1229">33</sup> “And
now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in
charge of the land of Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1230">34</sup> Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over
the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven
years of abundance. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1231">35</sup> They should collect all the food of
these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the
authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1232">36</sup> This food
should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the
seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the
country may not be ruined by the famine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1233">37</sup> The
plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1234">38</sup> So Pharaoh asked them,
“Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of
God<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1234b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1235">39</sup> Then
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you,
there is no one so discerning and wise as you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1236">40</sup> You shall be in charge of
my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only
with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph in Charge of Egypt</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1237">41</sup> So
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole
land of Egypt.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1238">42</sup>
Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on
Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a
gold chain around his neck. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1239">43</sup> He had him ride in a chariot as his
second-in-command,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1239c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and men
shouted before him, “Make way<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1239d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>!” Thus
he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1240">44</sup> Then
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one
will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1241">45</sup> Pharaoh gave Joseph the name
Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest
of On,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1241e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> to be his wife. And Joseph went
throughout the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1242">46</sup> Joseph
was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of
Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled
throughout Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1243">47</sup> During the seven years of abundance the
land produced plentifully. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1244">48</sup> Joseph collected all the food produced
in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the
cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields
surrounding it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1245">49</sup>
Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the
sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was
beyond measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1246">50</sup> Before
the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath
daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1247">51</sup> Joseph named his firstborn
Manasseh<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1247f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> and said, “It is because God has
made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1248">52</sup> The second son
he named Ephraim<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1248g"
title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> and said, “It is because God
has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1249">53</sup> The
seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1250">54</sup> and the seven years of
famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the
other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1251">55</sup> When all Egypt
began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food.
Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he
tells you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1252">56</sup> When
the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the
storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was
severe throughout Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1253">57</sup> And all the countries came to Egypt to
buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the
world.</p>
