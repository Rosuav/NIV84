<h4>Ezekiel 26</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Tyre</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21102">1</sup> In the
eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD
came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21103">2</sup>
“Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to
the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now
that she lies in ruins I will prosper,’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21104">3</sup> therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring many nations
against you, like the sea casting up its waves. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21105">4</sup> They will destroy the
walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her
rubble and make her a bare rock. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21106">5</sup> Out in the sea she will become a place
to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.
She will become plunder for the nations, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21107">6</sup> and her settlements on the mainland will
be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21108">7</sup> “For
this is what the Sovereign LORD says: From the north I am going to
bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21108a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> king of
Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and
a great army. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21109">8</sup>
He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he
will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls
and raise his shields against you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21110">9</sup> He will direct the blows of his
battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his
weapons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21111">10</sup> His
horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your
walls will tremble at the noise of the war horses, wagons and
chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls
have been broken through. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21112">11</sup> The hoofs of his horses will trample
all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your
strong pillars will fall to the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21113">12</sup> They will plunder your wealth and loot
your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your
fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21114">13</sup> I will put an
end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard
no more. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21115">14</sup> I
will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread
fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken,
declares the Sovereign LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21116">15</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands
tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the
slaughter takes place in you? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21117">16</sup> Then all the princes of the coast will
step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off
their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on
the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21118">17</sup> Then they will take up a
lament concerning you and say to you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘How you are destroyed, O city of renown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peopled by men of the sea!<br>
You were a power on the seas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you and your citizens;<br>
you put your terror<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all who lived there.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21119">18</sup> Now the
coastlands tremble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the day of your fall;<br>
the islands in the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are terrified at your collapse.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21120">19</sup> “This
is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I make you a desolate city,
like cities no longer inhabited, and when I bring the ocean depths
over you and its vast waters cover you, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21121">20</sup> then I will bring you down with those
who go down to the pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you
dwell in the earth below, as in ancient ruins, with those who go
down to the pit, and you will not return or take your
place<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21121b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in the land of the living.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21122">21</sup> I will bring
you to a horrible end and you will be no more. You will be sought,
but you will never again be found, declares the Sovereign
LORD.”</p>
