<h4>Jeremiah 35</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Recabites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19825">1</sup> This is
the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of
Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19826">2</sup> “Go to the Recabite family and invite
them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the LORD and
give them wine to drink.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19827">3</sup> So I
went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and
his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Recabites.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19828">4</sup> I brought them
into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son
of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the
officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the
doorkeeper. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19829">5</sup>
Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the
Recabite family and said to them, “Drink some wine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19830">6</sup> But
they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jonadab
son of Recab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your
descendants must ever drink wine. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19831">7</sup> Also you must never build houses, sow
seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things,
but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in
the land where you are nomads.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19832">8</sup> We have obeyed everything our forefather
Jonadab son of Recab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our
sons and daughters have ever drunk wine <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19833">9</sup> or built houses to live in or had
vineyards, fields or crops. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19834">10</sup> We have lived in tents and have fully
obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab commanded us. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19835">11</sup> But when Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to
Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19835a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and
Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19836">12</sup> Then
the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19837">13</sup> “This is what the LORD
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men of Judah and
the people of Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my
words?’ declares the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19838">14</sup> ‘Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons
not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they
do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command.
But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed
me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19839">15</sup> Again and
again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each
of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do
not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land
I have given to you and your fathers.” But you have not paid
attention or listened to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19840">16</sup> The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab
have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these
people have not obeyed me.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19841">17</sup>
“Therefore, this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel,
says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living
in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to
them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not
answer.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19842">18</sup> Then
Jeremiah said to the family of the Recabites, “This is what the
LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the
command of your forefather Jonadab and have followed all his
instructions and have done everything he ordered.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19843">19</sup> Therefore, this is what
the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab son of Recab
will never fail to have a man to serve me.’”</p>
