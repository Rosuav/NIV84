<h4>Genesis 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-459">1</sup> The two
angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the
gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and
bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-460">2</sup> “My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to
your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night
and then go on your way early in the morning.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night
in the square.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-461">3</sup> But he
insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his
house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and
they ate. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-462">4</sup> Before
they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of
Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-463">5</sup> They called to Lot, “Where
are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that
we can have sex with them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-464">6</sup> Lot went
outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-465">7</sup> and said, “No, my friends.
Don’t do this wicked thing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-466">8</sup> Look, I have two daughters who have never
slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what
you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they
have come under the protection of my roof.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-467">9</sup> “Get out
of our way,” they replied. And they said, “This fellow came here as
an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse
than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to
break down the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-468">10</sup> But the
men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut
the door. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-469">11</sup> Then
they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and
old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-470">12</sup> The two
men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or
daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them
out of here, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-471">13</sup>
because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD
against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy
it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-472">14</sup> So Lot
went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to
marry<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-472a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> his daughters. He said, “Hurry and
get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the
city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-473">15</sup> With
the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your
wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away
when the city is punished.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-474">16</sup> When he
hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and
of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the
LORD was merciful to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-475">17</sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one
of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop
anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept
away!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-476">18</sup> But Lot
said to them, “No, my lords,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-476b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> please!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-477">19</sup> Your<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-477c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> servant has found favor in
your<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-477d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> eyes, and you<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-477e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> have shown great kindness to me in
sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster
will overtake me, and I’ll die. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-478">20</sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run
to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it?
Then my life will be spared.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-479">21</sup> He said
to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not
overthrow the town you speak of. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-480">22</sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot
do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called
Zoar.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-480f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-481">23</sup> By the
time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-482">24</sup> Then the LORD rained down
burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the
heavens. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-483">25</sup> Thus he
overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those
living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-484">26</sup> But Lot’s wife
looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-485">27</sup> Early
the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he
had stood before the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-486">28</sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising
from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-487">29</sup> So when
God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and
he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities
where Lot had lived.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Lot and His Daughters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-488">30</sup> Lot and
his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he
was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a
cave. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-489">31</sup> One day
the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and
there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all
over the earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-490">32</sup>
Let’s get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and
preserve our family line through our father.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-491">33</sup> That
night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter
went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down
or when she got up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-492">34</sup> The
next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I lay
with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you
go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through
our father.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-493">35</sup> So
they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the
younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of
it when she lay down or when she got up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-494">36</sup> So both
of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-495">37</sup> The older daughter had a
son, and she named him Moab<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-495g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup>; he is
the father of the Moabites of today. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-496">38</sup> The younger daughter also had a son, and
she named him Ben-Ammi<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-496h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup>; he is
the father of the Ammonites of today.</p>
