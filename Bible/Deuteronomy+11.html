<h4>Deuteronomy 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Love and Obey the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5210">1</sup> Love the
LORD your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and
his commands always. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5211">2</sup> Remember today that your children were
not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the LORD
your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5212">3</sup> the signs he
performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to
Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5213">4</sup> what he did to the Egyptian
army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the
waters of the Red Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5213a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> as they
were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5214">5</sup> It was not your
children who saw what he did for you in the desert until you
arrived at this place, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5215">6</sup> and what he did to Dathan and Abiram,
sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right
in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their
households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5216">7</sup> But it was
your own eyes that saw all these great things the LORD has done.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5217">8</sup> Observe
therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may
have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are
crossing the Jordan to possess, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5218">9</sup> and so that you may live long in the land
that the LORD swore to your forefathers to give to them and their
descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5219">10</sup> The land you are entering
to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have
come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a
vegetable garden. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5220">11</sup> But the land you are crossing the Jordan
to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that
drinks rain from heaven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5221">12</sup> It is a land the LORD your God cares
for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the
beginning of the year to its end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5222">13</sup> So if
you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the
LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all
your soul— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5223">14</sup> then
I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring
rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and oil.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5224">15</sup> I will provide
grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be
satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5225">16</sup> Be
careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods
and bow down to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5226">17</sup> Then the LORD’s anger will burn against
you, and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the
ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the
good land the LORD is giving you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5227">18</sup> Fix these words of mine in your hearts
and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your
foreheads. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5228">19</sup>
Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at
home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when
you get up. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5229">20</sup>
Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5230">21</sup> so that your
days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the
LORD swore to give your forefathers, as many as the days that the
heavens are above the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5231">22</sup> If you
carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to
love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to
him— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5232">23</sup> then the
LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will
dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5233">24</sup> Every place where you set
your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert
to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the western
sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5233b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5234">25</sup> No man will be able to stand against
you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and
fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5235">26</sup> See, I
am setting before you today a blessing and a curse— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5236">27</sup> the blessing if you obey
the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5237">28</sup> the curse if
you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way
that I command you today by following other gods, which you have
not known. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5238">29</sup> When
the LORD your God has brought you into the land you are entering to
possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on
Mount Ebal the curses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5239">30</sup> As you know, these mountains are across
the Jordan, west of the road,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5239c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> toward
the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of
those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5240">31</sup> You are about
to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the
LORD your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are
living there, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5241">32</sup>
be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before
you today.</p>
