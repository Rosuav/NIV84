<h4>Matthew 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Divorce</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23762">1</sup> When
Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went
into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23763">2</sup> Large crowds
followed him, and he healed them there.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23764">3</sup> Some
Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a
man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23765">4</sup> “Haven’t you read,”</font> he replied,
<font class='woj'>“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them
male and female,’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23765a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23766">5</sup> and said, ‘For this reason a man will
leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two
will become one flesh’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23766b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23767">6</sup> So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not
separate.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23768">7</sup> “Why
then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a
certificate of divorce and send her away?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23769">8</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Moses permitted you to divorce your
wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from
the beginning.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23770">9</sup> I tell you that anyone who divorces his
wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman
commits adultery.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23771">10</sup> The
disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband
and wife, it is better not to marry.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23772">11</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Not everyone can accept this word, but
only those to whom it has been given.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23773">12</sup> For some
are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that
way by men; and others have renounced marriage<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23773c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> because of the kingdom of heaven. The
one who can accept this should accept it.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Little Children and Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23774">13</sup> Then
little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on
them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought
them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23775">14</sup> Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do
not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as
these.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23776">15</sup>
When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Rich Young Man</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23777">16</sup> Now a
man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do
to get eternal life?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23778">17</sup> “Why do you ask me about what is
good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“There is only One
who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the
commandments.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23779">18</sup>
“Which ones?” the man inquired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“‘Do not
murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false
testimony,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23780">19</sup> honor your father and
mother,’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23780d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and ‘love your neighbor as
yourself.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23780e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23781">20</sup> “All
these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23782">21</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“If you want to be perfect, go, sell
your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23783">22</sup> When
the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great
wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23784">23</sup> Then
Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the
truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23785">24</sup> Again I tell you, it is easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of God.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23786">25</sup> When
the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,
“Who then can be saved?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23787">26</sup> Jesus
looked at them and said, <font class='woj'>“With man this is
impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23788">27</sup> Peter
answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then
will there be for us?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23789">28</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, at the
renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious
throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23790">29</sup> And
everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or
mother<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23790f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> or children or fields for my sake
will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal
life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23791">30</sup> But many who are first will be last,
and many who are last will be first.</font></p>
