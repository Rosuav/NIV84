<h4>Exodus 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Moses and the Burning Bush</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1581">1</sup> Now Moses
was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came
to Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1582">2</sup> There the angel of the LORD appeared to
him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the
bush was on fire it did not burn up. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1583">3</sup> So Moses thought, “I will go over and see
this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1584">4</sup> When
the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from
within the bush, “Moses! Moses!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Moses said, “Here I am.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1585">5</sup> “Do not
come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place
where you are standing is holy ground.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1586">6</sup> Then he said, “I am the God of your
father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”
At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at
God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1587">7</sup> The
LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I
have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am
concerned about their suffering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1588">8</sup> So I have come down to rescue them from
the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land
into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and
honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites,
Hivites and Jebusites. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1589">9</sup> And now the cry of the Israelites has
reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1590">10</sup> So now,
go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites
out of Egypt.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1591">11</sup> But
Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring
the Israelites out of Egypt?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1592">12</sup> And
God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you
that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people
out of Egypt, you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1592a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> will
worship God on this mountain.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1593">13</sup> Moses
said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The
God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is
his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1594">14</sup> God
said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-1594b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> This is
what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to
you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1595">15</sup> God
also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1595c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> the God of your fathers—the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’
This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered
from generation to generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1596">16</sup> “Go,
assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God
of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me
and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done
to you in Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1597">17</sup> And I have promised to bring you up out
of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with
milk and honey.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1598">18</sup> “The
elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to
go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the
Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the
desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1599">19</sup> But I know that the king
of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1600">20</sup> So I will
stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders
that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1601">21</sup> “And I
will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so
that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1602">22</sup> Every woman is to ask her
neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver
and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and
daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”</p>
