<h4>2 Chronicles 29</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Hezekiah Purifies the Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11793">1</sup> Hezekiah
was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter
of Zechariah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11794">2</sup>
He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father
David had done.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11795">3</sup> In the
first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of
the temple of the LORD and repaired them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11796">4</sup> He brought in the priests and the
Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11797">5</sup> and said: “Listen to me,
Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the
LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove all defilement from the
sanctuary. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11798">6</sup> Our
fathers were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the LORD our
God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the LORD’s
dwelling place and turned their backs on him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11799">7</sup> They also shut the doors of the
portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present
any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11800">8</sup> Therefore, the
anger of the LORD has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made
them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with
your own eyes. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11801">9</sup>
This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons
and daughters and our wives are in captivity. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11802">10</sup> Now I intend to make a covenant with
the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn
away from us. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11803">11</sup>
My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to
stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn
incense.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11804">12</sup> Then
these Levites set to work:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Kohathites,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of
Azariah;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Merarites,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of
Jehallelel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Gershonites,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11805">13</sup> from
the descendants of Elizaphan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimri and Jeiel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the descendants of Asaph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zechariah and Mattaniah;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11806">14</sup> from
the descendants of Heman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehiel and Shimei;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the descendants of Jeduthun,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shemaiah and Uzziel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11807">15</sup> When
they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they
went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered,
following the word of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11808">16</sup> The priests went into the sanctuary of
the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the
LORD’s temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of
the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron
Valley. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11809">17</sup> They
began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by
the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD.
For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself,
finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11810">18</sup> Then
they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: “We have purified the
entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its
utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with
all its articles. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11811">19</sup> We have prepared and consecrated all
the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he
was king. They are now in front of the LORD’s altar.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11812">20</sup> Early
the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together
and went up to the temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11813">21</sup> They brought seven bulls, seven rams,
seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the
kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the
priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11814">22</sup> So
they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and
sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and
sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs
and sprinkled their blood on the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11815">23</sup> The goats for the sin offering were
brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands
on them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11816">24</sup> The
priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the
altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king
had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all
Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11817">25</sup> He
stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps
and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king’s seer
and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his
prophets. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11818">26</sup> So
the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments, and the priests
with their trumpets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11819">27</sup>
Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the
altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also,
accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11820">28</sup> The
whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the
trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the
burnt offering was completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11821">29</sup> When
the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him
knelt down and worshiped. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11822">30</sup> King Hezekiah and his officials ordered
the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph
the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads
and worshiped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11823">31</sup> Then
Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come
and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the
LORD.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and
all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11824">32</sup> The
number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a
hundred rams and two hundred male lambs—all of them for burnt
offerings to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11825">33</sup> The animals consecrated as sacrifices
amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11826">34</sup> The priests,
however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their
kinsmen the Levites helped them until the task was finished and
until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been
more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had
been. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11827">35</sup> There
were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the
fellowship offerings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11827a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and
the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the service of the temple of the LORD was
reestablished. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11828">36</sup>
Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about
for his people, because it was done so quickly.</p>
