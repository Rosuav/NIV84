<h4>Acts 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27013">1</sup> The
priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came
up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27014">2</sup> They were
greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and
proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27015">3</sup> They seized Peter and
John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the
next day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27016">4</sup> But
many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to
about five thousand.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27017">5</sup> The
next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27018">6</sup>
Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John,
Alexander and the other men of the high priest’s family.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27019">7</sup> They had Peter
and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what
power or what name did you do this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27020">8</sup> Then
Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and
elders of the people! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27021">9</sup> If we are being called to account today
for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was
healed, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27022">10</sup> then
know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised
from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27023">11</sup> He is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘the stone you builders rejected,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which has become the capstone.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27023a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27023b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27024">12</sup>
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under
heaven given to men by which we must be saved.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27025">13</sup> When
they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were
unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note
that these men had been with Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27026">14</sup> But since they could see the man who
had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they
could say. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27027">15</sup> So
they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred
together. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27028">16</sup>
“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everybody
living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle,
and we cannot deny it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27029">17</sup> But to stop this thing from spreading
any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no
longer to anyone in this name.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27030">18</sup> Then
they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach
at all in the name of Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27031">19</sup> But Peter and John replied, “Judge for
yourselves whether it is right in God’s sight to obey you rather
than God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27032">20</sup> For
we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27033">21</sup> After
further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to
punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had
happened. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27034">22</sup> For
the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Believers’ Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27035">23</sup> On their
release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27036">24</sup> When they heard this,
they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign
Lord,” they said, “you made the heaven and the earth and the sea,
and everything in them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27037">25</sup> You spoke by the Holy Spirit through
the mouth of your servant, our father David:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Why do the nations rage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples plot in vain?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27038">26</sup> The kings of
the earth take their stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rulers gather together<br>
against the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and against his Anointed One.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27038c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27038d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27039">27</sup>
Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and
the people<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27039e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> of Israel in this city to
conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27040">28</sup> They did what
your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27041">29</sup> Now, Lord,
consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word
with great boldness. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27042">30</sup> Stretch out your hand to heal and
perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy
servant Jesus.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27043">31</sup> After
they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they
were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God
boldly.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Believers Share Their
Possessions</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27044">32</sup> All the
believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of
his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27045">33</sup> With great
power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the
Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27046">34</sup> There were no needy persons among
them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold
them, brought the money from the sales <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27047">35</sup> and put it at the apostles’ feet, and
it was distributed to anyone as he had need.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27048">36</sup>
Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas
(which means Son of Encouragement), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27049">37</sup> sold a field he owned and brought the
money and put it at the apostles’ feet.</p>
