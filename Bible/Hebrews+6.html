<h4>Hebrews 6</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30030">1</sup>
Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go
on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from
acts that lead to death,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30030a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and of
faith in God, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30031">2</sup>
instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the
resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30032">3</sup> And God permitting, we
will do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30033">4</sup> It is
impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have
tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30034">5</sup> who have tasted
the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30035">6</sup> if they fall
away, to be brought back to repentance, because<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30035b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to their loss they are crucifying
the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public
disgrace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30036">7</sup> Land
that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a
crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of
God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30037">8</sup> But land
that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of
being cursed. In the end it will be burned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30038">9</sup> Even
though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better
things in your case—things that accompany salvation. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30039">10</sup> God is not unjust; he
will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you
have helped his people and continue to help them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30040">11</sup> We want each of you to
show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your
hope sure. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30041">12</sup> We
do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through
faith and patience inherit what has been promised.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Certainty of God’s Promise</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30042">13</sup> When God
made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him
to swear by, he swore by himself, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30043">14</sup> saying, “I will surely bless you and
give you many descendants.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30043c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30044">15</sup> And so after
waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30045">16</sup> Men
swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms
what is said and puts an end to all argument. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30046">17</sup> Because God wanted to make the
unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what
was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30047">18</sup> God did this so that, by two
unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly
encouraged. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30048">19</sup> We
have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It
enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30049">20</sup> where Jesus, who went
before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest
forever, in the order of Melchizedek.</p>
