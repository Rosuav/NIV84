<h4>2 Samuel 24</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Counts the Fighting Men</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8694">1</sup> Again the
anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David
against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8695">2</sup> So the
king said to Joab and the army commanders<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8695a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> with him, “Go throughout the
tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men,
so that I may know how many there are.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8696">3</sup> But
Joab replied to the king, “May the LORD your God multiply the
troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king
see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8697">4</sup> The
king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so
they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of
Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8698">5</sup> After
crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in
the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8699">6</sup> They went to Gilead and the
region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward
Sidon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8700">7</sup> Then they
went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites
and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of
Judah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8701">8</sup> After
they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem
at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8702">9</sup> Joab
reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel
there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle
a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8703">10</sup> David
was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and
he said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done.
Now, O LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have
done a very foolish thing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8704">11</sup> Before
David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad
the prophet, David’s seer: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8705">12</sup> “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the
LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me
to carry out against you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8706">13</sup> So Gad
went to David and said to him, “Shall there come upon you
three<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8706b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> years of famine in your land? Or
three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or
three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and
decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8707">14</sup> David
said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of
the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the
hands of men.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8708">15</sup> So the
LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the
time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to
Beersheba died. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8709">16</sup>
When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the
LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who
was afflicting the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel
of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the
Jebusite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8710">17</sup> When
David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to
the LORD, “I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are
but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my
family.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Builds an Altar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8711">18</sup> On that
day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to
the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8712">19</sup> So David went
up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8713">20</sup> When Araunah looked and saw the king
and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before
the king with his face to the ground.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8714">21</sup>
Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To buy your threshing floor,” David answered,
“so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people
may be stopped.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8715">22</sup>
Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever pleases
him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here
are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8716">23</sup> O king, Araunah gives all
this to the king.” Araunah also said to him, “May the LORD your God
accept you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8717">24</sup> But
the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I
will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me
nothing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So David bought the threshing floor and the
oxen and paid fifty shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8717c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of
silver for them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8718">25</sup> David built an altar to the LORD there
and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8718d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> Then the LORD answered prayer in
behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.</p>
