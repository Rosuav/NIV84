&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24712">1</sup> As he was
leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look,
Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24713">2</sup> “Do you see all these great
buildings?”</font> replied Jesus. <font class='woj'>“Not one stone
here will be left on another; every one will be thrown
down.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24714">3</sup> As
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,
Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24715">4</sup> “Tell us, when will these
things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to
be fulfilled?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24716">5</sup> Jesus
said to them: <font class='woj'>“Watch out that no one deceives
you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24717">6</sup> Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I
am he,’ and will deceive many.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24718">7</sup> When you hear of wars and
rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the
end is still to come.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24719">8</sup> Nation will rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in
various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth
pains.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24720">9</sup> “You must be on your guard. You will be
handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On
account of me you will stand before governors and kings as
witnesses to them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24721">10</sup> And the gospel must first be
preached to all nations.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24722">11</sup> Whenever you are arrested
and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say.
Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you
speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24723">12</sup> “Brother will betray brother to death,
and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents
and have them put to death.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24724">13</sup> All men will hate you
because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be
saved.</font></p>

causes desolation’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

where it<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24725b" title=

understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the
mountains.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24726">15</sup> Let no one on the roof of his house go
down or enter the house to take anything out.</font> <font class=

one in the field go back to get his cloak.</font> <font class=

dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing
mothers!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

winter,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24730">19</sup> because those will be days of distress
unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until
now—and never to be equaled again.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24731">20</sup> If the
Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for
the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened
them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24732">21</sup> At that time if anyone says to you,
‘Look, here is the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24733">22</sup> For
false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and
miracles to deceive the elect—if that were possible.</font>

Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</font>

"en-NIV1984-24738">27</sup> And he will send his angels and gather
his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the
ends of the heavens.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24739">28</sup> “Now learn this lesson from the fig
tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you
know that summer is near.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24740">29</sup> Even so, when you see
these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the
door.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24741">30</sup> I tell you the truth, this
generation<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-24741e"

until all these things have happened.</font> <font class=

and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass

come.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24745">34</sup> It’s like a man going away: He leaves
his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned
task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24746">35</sup> “Therefore keep watch because you do
not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the
evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at
dawn.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
