<h4>Lamentations 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20356">1</sup>
<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20356a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>I am the man who has seen
affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the rod of his wrath.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20357">2</sup> He has driven
me away and made me walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in darkness rather than light;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20358">3</sup> indeed, he has
turned his hand against me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again and again, all day long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20359">4</sup> He has
made my skin and my flesh grow old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has broken my bones.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20360">5</sup> He has besieged
me and surrounded me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bitterness and hardship.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20361">6</sup> He has made me
dwell in darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like those long dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20362">7</sup> He has
walled me in so I cannot escape;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has weighed me down with chains.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20363">8</sup> Even when I
call out or cry for help,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he shuts out my prayer.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20364">9</sup> He has barred
my way with blocks of stone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has made my paths crooked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20365">10</sup> Like
a bear lying in wait,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lion in hiding,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20366">11</sup> he dragged me
from the path and mangled me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and left me without help.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20367">12</sup> He drew his
bow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made me the target for his arrows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20368">13</sup> He
pierced my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with arrows from his quiver.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20369">14</sup> I became the
laughingstock of all my people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they mock me in song all day long.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20370">15</sup> He has filled
me with bitter herbs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sated me with gall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20371">16</sup> He
has broken my teeth with gravel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has trampled me in the dust.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20372">17</sup> I have been
deprived of peace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten what prosperity is.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20373">18</sup> So I say, “My
splendor is gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all that I had hoped from the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20374">19</sup> I
remember my affliction and my wandering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bitterness and the gall.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20375">20</sup> I well
remember them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my soul is downcast within me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20376">21</sup> Yet this I
call to mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore I have hope:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20377">22</sup>
Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his compassions never fail.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20378">23</sup> They are new
every morning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great is your faithfulness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20379">24</sup> I say to
myself, “The LORD is my portion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I will wait for him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20380">25</sup> The
LORD is good to those whose hope is in him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the one who seeks him;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20381">26</sup> it is good to
wait quietly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the salvation of the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20382">27</sup> It is good for
a man to bear the yoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while he is young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20383">28</sup> Let
him sit alone in silence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD has laid it on him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20384">29</sup> Let him bury
his face in the dust—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there may yet be hope.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20385">30</sup> Let him offer
his cheek to one who would strike him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let him be filled with disgrace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20386">31</sup> For
men are not cast off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Lord forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20387">32</sup> Though he
brings grief, he will show compassion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so great is his unfailing love.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20388">33</sup> For he does
not willingly bring affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or grief to the children of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20389">34</sup> To
crush underfoot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all prisoners in the land,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20390">35</sup> to deny a man
his rights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the Most High,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20391">36</sup> to deprive a
man of justice—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not the Lord see such things?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20392">37</sup> Who
can speak and have it happen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Lord has not decreed it?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20393">38</sup> Is it not from
the mouth of the Most High<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that both calamities and good things come?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20394">39</sup> Why should any
living man complain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when punished for his sins?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20395">40</sup> Let
us examine our ways and test them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let us return to the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20396">41</sup> Let us lift up
our hearts and our hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to God in heaven, and say:<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20397">42</sup> “We have
sinned and rebelled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have not forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20398">43</sup> “You
have covered yourself with anger and pursued us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have slain without pity.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20399">44</sup> You have
covered yourself with a cloud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that no prayer can get through.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20400">45</sup> You have made
us scum and refuse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20401">46</sup> “All
our enemies have opened their mouths<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wide against us.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20402">47</sup> We have
suffered terror and pitfalls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruin and destruction.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20403">48</sup> Streams of
tears flow from my eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because my people are destroyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20404">49</sup> My
eyes will flow unceasingly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without relief,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20405">50</sup> until the LORD
looks down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven and sees.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20406">51</sup> What I see
brings grief to my soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all the women of my city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20407">52</sup> Those
who were my enemies without cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunted me like a bird.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20408">53</sup> They tried to
end my life in a pit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and threw stones at me;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20409">54</sup> the waters
closed over my head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I thought I was about to be cut off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20410">55</sup> I
called on your name, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the depths of the pit.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20411">56</sup> You heard my
plea: “Do not close your ears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my cry for relief.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20412">57</sup> You came near
when I called you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you said, “Do not fear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20413">58</sup> O
Lord, you took up my case;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you redeemed my life.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20414">59</sup> You have seen,
O LORD, the wrong done to me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uphold my cause!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20415">60</sup> You have seen
the depth of their vengeance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their plots against me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20416">61</sup> O
LORD, you have heard their insults,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their plots against me—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20417">62</sup> what my
enemies whisper and mutter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me all day long.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20418">63</sup> Look at them!
Sitting or standing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they mock me in their songs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20419">64</sup> Pay
them back what they deserve, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what their hands have done.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20420">65</sup> Put a veil
over their hearts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may your curse be on them!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20421">66</sup> Pursue them in
anger and destroy them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from under the heavens of the LORD.</p>
