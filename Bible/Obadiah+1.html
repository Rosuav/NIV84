<h4>Obadiah 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22512">1</sup> The
vision of Obadiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Sovereign LORD says about
Edom—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a message from the LORD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An envoy was sent to the nations to say,<br>
“Rise, and let us go against her for battle”—</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22513">2</sup> “See,
I will make you small among the nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be utterly despised.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22514">3</sup> The pride of
your heart has deceived you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in the clefts of the
rocks<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22514a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make your home on the heights,<br>
you who say to yourself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22515">4</sup> Though you soar
like the eagle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make your nest among the stars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from there I will bring you down,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22516">5</sup> “If thieves
came to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if robbers in the night—<br>
Oh, what a disaster awaits you—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not steal only as much as they
wanted?<br>
If grape pickers came to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not leave a few grapes?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22517">6</sup> But how Esau
will be ransacked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hidden treasures pillaged!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22518">7</sup> All your allies
will force you to the border;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your friends will deceive and overpower you;<br>
those who eat your bread will set a trap for you,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22518b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will not detect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22519">8</sup> “In
that day,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“will I not destroy the wise men of Edom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of understanding in the mountains of
Esau?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22520">9</sup> Your warriors,
O Teman, will be terrified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and everyone in Esau’s mountains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be cut down in the slaughter.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22521">10</sup> Because of the
violence against your brother Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be covered with shame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be destroyed forever.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22522">11</sup> On the day you
stood aloof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while strangers carried off his wealth<br>
and foreigners entered his gates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast lots for Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were like one of them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22523">12</sup> You should not
look down on your brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of his misfortune,<br>
nor rejoice over the people of Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their destruction,<br>
nor boast so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their trouble.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22524">13</sup> You should not
march through the gates of my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster,<br>
nor look down on them in their calamity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster,<br>
nor seize their wealth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22525">14</sup> You should not
wait at the crossroads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cut down their fugitives,<br>
nor hand over their survivors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22526">15</sup> “The
day of the LORD is near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all nations.<br>
As you have done, it will be done to you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your deeds will return upon your own head.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22527">16</sup> Just as you
drank on my holy hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so all the nations will drink continually;<br>
they will drink and drink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be as if they had never been.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22528">17</sup> But on Mount
Zion will be deliverance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be holy,<br>
and the house of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will possess its inheritance.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22529">18</sup> The house of
Jacob will be a fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the house of Joseph a flame;<br>
the house of Esau will be stubble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will set it on fire and consume it.<br>
There will be no survivors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the house of Esau.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
LORD has spoken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22530">19</sup>
People from the Negev will occupy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mountains of Esau,<br>
and people from the foothills will possess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of the Philistines.<br>
They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Benjamin will possess Gilead.<br>
