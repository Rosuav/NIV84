<h4>Hebrews 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Sabbath-Rest for the People of
God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30000">1</sup>
Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let
us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30001">2</sup> For we also
have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the
message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard
did not combine it with faith.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30001a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30002">3</sup> Now we who have
believed enter that rest, just as God has said,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So I declared on oath in my anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘They shall never enter my rest.’”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30002b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet his work has been finished since the
creation of the world. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30003">4</sup> For somewhere he has spoken about the
seventh day in these words: “And on the seventh day God rested from
all his work.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30003c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30004">5</sup> And again in the passage above he says,
“They shall never enter my rest.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30005">6</sup> It
still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who
formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of
their disobedience. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30006">7</sup> Therefore God again set a certain day,
calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as
was said before:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today, if you hear his voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30006d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30007">8</sup> For if
Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about
another day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30008">9</sup>
There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30009">10</sup> for anyone who
enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did
from his. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30010">11</sup> Let
us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one
will fall by following their example of disobedience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30011">12</sup> For
the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged
sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and
marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30012">13</sup> Nothing in all
creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and
laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus the Great High Priest</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30013">14</sup>
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through
the heavens,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30013e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold firmly to the faith we profess. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30014">15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who is
unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has
been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30015">16</sup> Let us then
approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may
receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
