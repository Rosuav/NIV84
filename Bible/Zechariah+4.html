<h4>Zechariah 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Gold Lampstand and the Two Olive
Trees</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22924">1</sup> Then the
angel who talked with me returned and wakened me, as a man is
wakened from his sleep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22925">2</sup> He asked me, “What do you see?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with
a bowl at the top and seven lights on it, with seven channels to
the lights. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22926">3</sup>
Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl
and the other on its left.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22927">4</sup> I
asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22928">5</sup> He
answered, “Do you not know what these are?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, my lord,” I replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22929">6</sup> So he
said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by
might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22930">7</sup>
“What<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22930a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> are you, O mighty mountain? Before
Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the
capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22931">8</sup> Then
the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-22932">9</sup> “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the
foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then
you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22933">10</sup> “Who
despises the day of small things? Men will rejoice when they see
the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“(These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which
range throughout the earth.)”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22934">11</sup> Then
I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and
the left of the lampstand?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22935">12</sup> Again
I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold
pipes that pour out golden oil?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22936">13</sup> He
replied, “Do you not know what these are?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, my lord,” I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22937">14</sup> So he
said, “These are the two who are anointed to<sup class=
