<h4>Joshua 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Circumcision at Gilgal</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5936">1</sup> Now when
all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite
kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan
before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts
melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5937">2</sup> At that
time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the
Israelites again.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5938">3</sup> So Joshua made flint knives and
circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5938a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5939">4</sup> Now
this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men
of military age—died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5940">5</sup> All the people
that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the
desert during the journey from Egypt had not. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5941">6</sup> The Israelites had moved about in the
desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when
they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For
the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he
had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with
milk and honey. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5942">7</sup>
So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones
Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had
not been circumcised on the way. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5943">8</sup> And after the whole nation had been
circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were
healed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5944">9</sup> Then
the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of
Egypt from you.” So the place has been called Gilgal<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5944b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5945">10</sup> On the
evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal
on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5946">11</sup> The day after
the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the
land: unleavened bread and roasted grain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5947">12</sup> The manna stopped the day
after<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5947c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> they ate this food from the land;
there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year
they ate of the produce of Canaan.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Fall of Jericho</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5948">13</sup> Now when
Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in
front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him
and asked, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5949">14</sup>
“Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the LORD I
have now come.” Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in
reverence, and asked him, “What message does my Lord<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5949d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> have for his servant?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5950">15</sup> The
commander of the LORD’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for
the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.</p>
