<h4>Ezekiel 37</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Valley of Dry Bones</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21399">1</sup> The hand
of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the
LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21400">2</sup> He led me back
and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of
the valley, bones that were very dry. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21401">3</sup> He asked me, “Son of man, can these
bones live?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, “O Sovereign LORD, you alone
know.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21402">4</sup> Then
he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry
bones, hear the word of the LORD! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21403">5</sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says to
these bones: I will make breath<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21403a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> enter
you, and you will come to life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21404">6</sup> I will attach tendons to you and make
flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in
you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the
LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21405">7</sup> So I
prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was
a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to
bone. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21406">8</sup> I looked,
and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but
there was no breath in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21407">9</sup> Then
he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and
say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come from the
four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may
live.’” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21408">10</sup> So I
prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came
to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21409">11</sup> Then
he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we
are cut off.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21410">12</sup>
Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: O my people, I am going to open your graves and bring
you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21411">13</sup> Then you, my
people, will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and
bring you up from them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21412">14</sup> I will put my Spirit in you and you
will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will
know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the
LORD.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">One Nation Under One King</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21413">15</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21414">16</sup> “Son of man, take a stick of wood and
write on it, ‘Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with
him.’ Then take another stick of wood, and write on it, ‘Ephraim’s
stick, belonging to Joseph and all the house of Israel associated
with him.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21415">17</sup>
Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in
your hand.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21416">18</sup> “When
your countrymen ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21417">19</sup> say to them,
‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to take the stick
of Joseph—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and of the Israelite tribes
associated with him, and join it to Judah’s stick, making them a
single stick of wood, and they will become one in my hand.’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21418">20</sup> Hold before
their eyes the sticks you have written on <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21419">21</sup> and say to them, ‘This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations
where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring
them back into their own land. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21420">22</sup> I will make them one nation in the
land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all
of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into
two kingdoms. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21421">23</sup>
They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile
images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all
their sinful backsliding,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21421b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and I
will cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their
God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21422">24</sup> “‘My
servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one
shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my
decrees. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21423">25</sup> They
will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where
your fathers lived. They and their children and their children’s
children will live there forever, and David my servant will be
their prince forever. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21424">26</sup> I will make a covenant of peace with
them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and
increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them
forever. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21425">27</sup> My
dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they
will be my people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21426">28</sup> Then the nations will know that I the
LORD make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them
forever.’”</p>
