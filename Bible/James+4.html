<h4>James 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Submit Yourselves to God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30323">1</sup> What
causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your
desires that battle within you? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30324">2</sup> You want something but don’t get it. You
kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and
fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30325">3</sup> When you ask, you do not
receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend
what you get on your pleasures.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30326">4</sup> You
adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world is
hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world
becomes an enemy of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30327">5</sup> Or do you think Scripture says without
reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies
intensely?<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30327a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30328">6</sup> But he gives us more grace. That is why
Scripture says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God opposes the proud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gives grace to the humble.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30328b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30329">7</sup> Submit
yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30330">8</sup> Come near
to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners,
and purify your hearts, you double-minded. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30331">9</sup> Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your
laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30332">10</sup> Humble yourselves before the Lord,
and he will lift you up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30333">11</sup>
Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his
brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When
you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment
on it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30334">12</sup> There
is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and
destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Boasting About Tomorrow</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30335">13</sup> Now
listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that
city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30336">14</sup> Why, you do
not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are
a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30337">15</sup> Instead, you
ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this
or that.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30338">16</sup> As
it is, you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30339">17</sup> Anyone, then, who knows
the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins.
