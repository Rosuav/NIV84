<h5 class="passage-header">Eating Blood Forbidden</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3237">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3238">2</sup>
“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to
them: ‘This is what the LORD has commanded: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3239">3</sup> Any Israelite who sacrifices an
ox,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3239a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> a lamb or a goat in the camp or
outside of it <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3240">4</sup>
instead of bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to
present it as an offering to the LORD in front of the tabernacle of
the LORD—that man shall be considered guilty of bloodshed; he has
shed blood and must be cut off from his people. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3241">5</sup> This is so the Israelites
will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they are now making in the
open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the
LORD, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as
fellowship offerings.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3241b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3242">6</sup> The priest is to
sprinkle the blood against the altar of the LORD at the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3243">7</sup> They must
no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat
idols<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3243c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to whom they prostitute
themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the
generations to come.’
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3244">8</sup> “Say to
them: ‘Any Israelite or any alien living among them who offers a
burnt offering or sacrifice <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3245">9</sup> and does not bring it to the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD—that man must be
cut off from his people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3246">10</sup> “‘Any
Israelite or any alien living among them who eats any blood—I will
set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off
from his people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3247">11</sup> For the life of a creature is in the
blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves
on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3248">12</sup> Therefore I say
to the Israelites, “None of you may eat blood, nor may an alien
living among you eat blood.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3249">13</sup> “‘Any
Israelite or any alien living among you who hunts any animal or
bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with
earth, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3250">14</sup> because
the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to
the Israelites, “You must not eat the blood of any creature,
because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it
must be cut off.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3251">15</sup>
“‘Anyone, whether native-born or alien, who eats anything found
dead or torn by wild animals must wash his clothes and bathe with
water, and he will be ceremonially unclean till evening; then he
will be clean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3252">16</sup>
But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself, he will be
held responsible.’”</p>
