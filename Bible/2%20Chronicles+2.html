<h4>2 Chronicles 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Preparations for Building the
Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11213">1</sup> Solomon
gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the LORD and a royal
palace for himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11214">2</sup> He conscripted seventy thousand men as
carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and
thirty-six hundred as foremen over them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11215">3</sup>
Solomon sent this message to Hiram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11215a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> king
of Tyre:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Send me cedar logs as you did for my father
David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11216">4</sup> Now I am about
to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate
it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out
the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings
every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the
appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is a lasting ordinance
for Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11217">5</sup> “The
temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is
greater than all other gods. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11218">6</sup> But who is able to build a temple for
him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain
him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to
burn sacrifices before him?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11219">7</sup> “Send
me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and
iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the
art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled
craftsmen, whom my father David provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11220">8</sup> “Send
me also cedar, pine and algum<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11220b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> logs
from Lebanon, for I know that your men are skilled in cutting
timber there. My men will work with yours <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11221">9</sup> to provide me with plenty of lumber,
because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11222">10</sup> I will give
your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand
cors<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11222c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of ground wheat, twenty thousand
cors of barley, twenty thousand baths<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11222d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of wine and twenty thousand baths
of olive oil.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11223">11</sup> Hiram
king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because the LORD loves his people, he has
made you their king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11224">12</sup> And
Hiram added:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who
made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed
with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the
LORD and a palace for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11225">13</sup> “I am
sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11226">14</sup> whose mother was from Dan and whose
father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver,
bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and
crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of
engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work
with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, David your
father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11227">15</sup> “Now
let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive
oil and wine he promised, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11228">16</sup> and we will cut all the logs from
Lebanon that you need and will float them in rafts by sea down to
Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11229">17</sup>
Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in Israel, after
the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be
153,600. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11230">18</sup> He
assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be
stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the
people working.</p>
