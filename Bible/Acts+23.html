<div class="result-text-style-normal">
<h4>Acts 23</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27723">1</sup> Paul
looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have
fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27724">2</sup> At this the
high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him
on the mouth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27725">3</sup>
Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!
You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself
violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27726">4</sup> Those
who were standing near Paul said, “You dare to insult God’s high
priest?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27727">5</sup> Paul
replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest;
for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your
people.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27727a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27728">6</sup> Then
Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others
Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my
hope in the resurrection of the dead.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27729">7</sup> When he said this, a dispute broke out
between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was
divided. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27730">8</sup> (The
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are
neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them
all.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27731">9</sup> There
was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were
Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong
with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken
to him?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27732">10</sup> The
dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would
be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and
take him away from them by force and bring him into the
barracks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27733">11</sup> The
following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, <font class=
'woj'>“Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem,
so you must also testify in Rome.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plot to Kill Paul</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27734">12</sup> The next
morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an
oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27735">13</sup> More than forty men were
involved in this plot. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27736">14</sup> They went to the chief priests and
elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything
until we have killed Paul. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27737">15</sup> Now then, you and the Sanhedrin
petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of
wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to
kill him before he gets here.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27738">16</sup> But
when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the
barracks and told Paul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27739">17</sup> Then
Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to
the commander; he has something to tell him.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27740">18</sup> So he took him to the commander.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent
for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has
something to tell you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27741">19</sup> The
commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked,
“What is it you want to tell me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27742">20</sup> He
said: “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the
Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate
information about him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27743">21</sup> Don’t give in to them, because more
than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken
an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are
ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27744">22</sup> The
commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, “Don’t tell
anyone that you have reported this to me.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul Transferred to Caesarea</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27745">23</sup> Then he
called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a
detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two
hundred spearmen<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27745b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> to go to
Caesarea at nine tonight. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27746">24</sup> Provide mounts for Paul so that he may
be taken safely to Governor Felix.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27747">25</sup> He
wrote a letter as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27748">26</sup>
Claudius Lysias,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To His Excellency, Governor Felix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27749">27</sup> This
man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I
came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a
Roman citizen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27750">28</sup>
I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to
their Sanhedrin. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27751">29</sup> I found that the accusation had to do
with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him
that deserved death or imprisonment. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27752">30</sup> When I was informed of a plot to be
carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also
ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27753">31</sup> So
the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during
the night and brought him as far as Antipatris. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27754">32</sup> The next day they let the
cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27755">33</sup> When the
cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the
governor and handed Paul over to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27756">34</sup> The governor read the letter and asked
what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27757">35</sup> he said, “I
will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered
that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.</p>
