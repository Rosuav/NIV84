<h3><span id="en-NIV1984-7026" class="text Judg-19-1">A Levite and
His Concubine</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-19-1"><span class=
"chapternum">19&nbsp;</span>In those days Israel had no
king.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Judg-19-1">Now a Levite who lived in a remote
area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem
in Judah.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7027" class=
"text Judg-19-2"><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>But she was
unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father’s house
in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-7028" class="text Judg-19-3"><sup class=
"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>her husband went to her to persuade her to
return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him
into her father’s house, and when her father saw him, he gladly
welcomed him.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7029" class=
"text Judg-19-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>His
father-in-law, the girl’s father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he
remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping
there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7030" class="text Judg-19-5"><sup class=
"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>On the fourth day they got up early and he
prepared to leave, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law,
“Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.”</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-7031" class="text Judg-19-6"><sup class=
"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>So the two of them sat down to eat and
drink together. Afterward the girl’s father said, “Please stay
tonight and enjoy yourself. ”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7032"
class="text Judg-19-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>And when
the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed
there that night.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7033" class=
"text Judg-19-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>On the morning
of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl’s father said,
“Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!” So the two of them ate
together.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7034" class="text Judg-19-9"><sup class=
"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Then when the man, with his concubine and
his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl’s father,
said, “Now look, it’s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day
is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you
can get up and be on your way home.”</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-7035" class="text Judg-19-10"><sup class=
"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>But, unwilling to stay another night, the
man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two
saddled donkeys and his concubine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7036" class="text Judg-19-11"><sup class=
"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>When they were near Jebus and the day was
almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let’s stop at
this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7037" class="text Judg-19-12"><sup class=
"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>His master replied, “No. We won’t go into
an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to
Gibeah.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7038" class=
"text Judg-19-13"><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>He added,
“Come, let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in
one of those places.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7039" class=
"text Judg-19-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>So they went
on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-7040" class="text Judg-19-15"><sup class=
"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>There they stopped to spend the night.
They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his
home for the night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7041" class="text Judg-19-16"><sup class=
"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>That evening an old man from the hill
country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place
were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.</span>
<span id="en-NIV1984-7042" class="text Judg-19-17"><sup class=
"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>When he looked and saw the traveler in the
city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going? Where did you
come from?” </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7043" class="text Judg-19-18"><sup class=
"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>He answered, “We are on our way from
Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim
where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going
to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=
"small-caps">Lord.</span> No one has taken me into his
house.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7044" class=
"text Judg-19-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>We have both
straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves
your servants—me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We
don’t need anything.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7045" class="text Judg-19-20"><sup class=
"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>“You are welcome at my house,” the old man
said. “Let me supply whatever you need. Only don’t spend the night
in the square.”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7046" class=
"text Judg-19-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>So he took
him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their
feet, they had something to eat and drink. </span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7047" class="text Judg-19-22"><sup class=
"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>While they were enjoying themselves, some
of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the
door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out
the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.
”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7048" class="text Judg-19-23"><sup class=
"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>The owner of the house went outside and
said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is
my guest, don’t do this disgraceful thing.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-7049" class="text Judg-19-24"><sup class=
"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his
concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them
and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don’t do such a
disgraceful thing.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7050" class="text Judg-19-25"><sup class=
"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>But the men would not listen to him. So
the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they
raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let
her go.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7051" class=
"text Judg-19-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>At daybreak
the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell
down at the door and lay there until daylight.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7052" class="text Judg-19-27"><sup class=
"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>When her master got up in the morning and
opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his
way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house,
with her hands on the threshold.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7053"
class="text Judg-19-28"><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>He said
to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man
put her on his donkey and set out for home.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-7054" class="text Judg-19-29"><sup class=
"versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>When he reached home, he took a knife and
cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them
into all the areas of Israel.</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-7055"
class="text Judg-19-30"><sup class=
"versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Everyone who saw it said, “Such a thing
has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came
up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!
