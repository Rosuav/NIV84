<h4>2 Chronicles 31</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11856">1</sup> When
all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the
towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah
poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout
Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had
destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns
and to their own property.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Contributions for Worship</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11857">2</sup> Hezekiah
assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them
according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt
offerings and fellowship offerings,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11857a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to
minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the
LORD’s dwelling. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11858">3</sup> The king contributed from his own
possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the
burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons and appointed feasts as
written in the Law of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11859">4</sup> He ordered the people living in
Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they
could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11860">5</sup> As soon as the order went
out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain,
new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They
brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11861">6</sup> The men of Israel and
Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their
herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the
LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11862">7</sup> They began doing this in the third
month and finished in the seventh month. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11863">8</sup> When Hezekiah and his officials came and
saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and blessed his people Israel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11864">9</sup>
Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11865">10</sup> and Azariah the chief
priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began
to bring their contributions to the temple of the LORD, we have had
enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed his
people, and this great amount is left over.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11866">11</sup>
Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the
LORD, and this was done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11867">12</sup> Then they faithfully brought in the
contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Conaniah, a Levite, was
in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11868">13</sup> Jehiel,
Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath
and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother,
by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge
of the temple of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11869">14</sup> Kore
son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of
the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions
made to the LORD and also the consecrated gifts. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11870">15</sup> Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua,
Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the
towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests
according to their divisions, old and young alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11871">16</sup> In
addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more
whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter
the temple of the LORD to perform the daily duties of their various
tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11872">17</sup> And they
distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the
genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old
or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11873">18</sup> They included
all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the
whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were
faithful in consecrating themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11874">19</sup> As
for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm
lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated
by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all
who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11875">20</sup> This
is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and
right and faithful before the LORD his God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11876">21</sup> In everything that he undertook in
the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the
commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he
prospered.</p>
