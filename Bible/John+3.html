<h4>John 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Teaches Nicodemus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26112">1</sup> Now there
was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish
ruling council. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26113">2</sup>
He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know you are a
teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the
miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26114">3</sup> In
reply Jesus declared, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, no
one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26114a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26115">4</sup> “How
can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely he
cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26116">5</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, no one can enter
the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the
Spirit.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26117">6</sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the
Spirit<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26117b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> gives birth to spirit.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26118">7</sup> You should not be surprised at my
saying, ‘You<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26118c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> must be born again.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26119">8</sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You
hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it
is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26120">9</sup> “How
can this be?” Nicodemus asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26121">10</sup> “You are Israel’s teacher,”</font> said
Jesus, <font class='woj'>“and do you not understand these
things?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26122">11</sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what
we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people
do not accept our testimony.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26123">12</sup> I have spoken to you of
earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if
I speak of heavenly things?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26124">13</sup> No one has ever gone into
heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of
Man.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26124d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26125">14</sup> Just as Moses lifted up
the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted
up,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26126">15</sup> that everyone who believes in him may
have eternal life.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26126e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26127">16</sup> “For God so loved the world that he
gave his one and only Son,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26127f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> that
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
life.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26128">17</sup> For God did not send his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but to save the world through
him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26129">18</sup> Whoever believes in him is not
condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already
because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only
Son.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26129g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26130">19</sup> This is the verdict:
Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of
light because their deeds were evil.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26131">20</sup> Everyone
who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for
fear that his deeds will be exposed.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26132">21</sup> But
whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be
seen plainly that what he has done has been done through
God.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26132h" title=

<h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist’s Testimony About
Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26133">22</sup> After
this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside,
where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26134">23</sup> Now John also was
baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water,
and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26135">24</sup> (This was before John was
put in prison.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26136">25</sup> An argument developed between some of
John’s disciples and a certain Jew<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26136i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> over the
matter of ceremonial washing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26137">26</sup> They came to John and said to him,
“Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the
Jordan—the one you testified about—well, he is baptizing, and
everyone is going to him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26138">27</sup> To
this John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from
heaven. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26139">28</sup> You
yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26139j" title=
"See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> but am sent ahead of him.’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26140">29</sup> The bride
belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom
waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the
bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26141">30</sup> He must become
greater; I must become less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26142">31</sup> “The
one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the
earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The
one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26143">32</sup> He testifies to what he has seen and
heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26144">33</sup> The man who has accepted it has
certified that God is truthful. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26145">34</sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks
the words of God, for God<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

Spirit without limit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26146">35</sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed
everything in his hands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26147">36</sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal
life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s
wrath remains on him.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
