<h3>Ezekiel 3</h3>

<div class="result-text-style-normal">
<h4>Ezekiel 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20504">1</sup> And he
said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll;
then go and speak to the house of Israel.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-20505">2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he gave me
the scroll to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20506">3</sup> Then
he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and
fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as
honey in my mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20507">4</sup> He
then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and
speak my words to them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20508">5</sup> You are not being sent to a people of
obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20509">6</sup> not to many
peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you
cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would
have listened to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20510">7</sup> But the house of Israel is not willing
to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for
the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20511">8</sup> But I will make you as
unyielding and hardened as they are. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20512">9</sup> I will make your forehead like the
hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or
terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20513">10</sup> And
he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all
the words I speak to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20514">11</sup> Go now to your countrymen in exile and
speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says,’
whether they listen or fail to listen.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20515">12</sup> Then
the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling
sound—May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20516">13</sup> the sound of
the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and
the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20517">14</sup> The Spirit
then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in
the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20518">15</sup> I came to the
exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where
they were living, I sat among them for seven days—overwhelmed.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning to Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20519">16</sup> At the
end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20520">17</sup> “Son of man, I have made
you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak
and give them warning from me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20521">18</sup> When I say to a wicked man, ‘You will
surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him
from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will
die for<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20521a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> his sin, and I will hold you
accountable for his blood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20522">19</sup> But if you do warn the wicked man and
he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will
die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20523">20</sup>
“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does
evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since
you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous things
he did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for
his blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20524">21</sup> But
if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he
will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved
yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20525">22</sup> The
hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, “Get up and
go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20526">23</sup> So I got up and went out
to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like
the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20527">24</sup> Then
the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me
and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20528">25</sup> And you, son of man, they
will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out
among the people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20529">26</sup> I will make your tongue stick to the
roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke
them, though they are a rebellious house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20530">27</sup> But when I speak to you, I will open
your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign
LORD says.’ Whoever will listen let him listen, and whoever will
refuse let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.</p>
