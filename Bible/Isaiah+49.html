<h4>Isaiah 49</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Servant of the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18638">1</sup> Listen to
me, you islands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear this, you distant nations:<br>
Before I was born the LORD called me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from my birth he has made mention of my name.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18639">2</sup> He made my
mouth like a sharpened sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br>
he made me into a polished arrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and concealed me in his quiver.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18640">3</sup> He said to me,
“You are my servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18641">4</sup> But I said, “I
have labored to no purpose;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent my strength in vain and for
nothing.<br>
Yet what is due me is in the LORD’s hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my reward is with my God.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18642">5</sup> And
now the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who formed me in the womb to be his
servant<br>
to bring Jacob back to him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gather Israel to himself,<br>
for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my God has been my strength—<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18643">6</sup> he says:<br>
“It is too small a thing for you to be my servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to restore the tribes of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring back those of Israel I have kept.<br>
I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you may bring my salvation to the ends of
the earth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18644">7</sup> This
is what the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel—<br>
to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the servant of rulers:<br>
“Kings will see you and rise up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;princes will see and bow down,<br>
because of the LORD, who is faithful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Restoration of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18645">8</sup> This is
what the LORD says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In the time of my favor I will answer
you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the day of salvation I will help you;<br>
I will keep you and will make you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be a covenant for the people,<br>
to restore the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to reassign its desolate inheritances,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18646">9</sup> to say to the
captives, ‘Come out,’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to those in darkness, ‘Be free!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They will feed beside the roads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and find pasture on every barren hill.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18647">10</sup> They will
neither hunger nor thirst,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon
them.<br>
He who has compassion on them will guide them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lead them beside springs of water.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18648">11</sup> I will turn
all my mountains into roads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my highways will be raised up.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18649">12</sup> See, they will
come from afar—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some from the north, some from the west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some from the region of Aswan.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18649a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18650">13</sup> Shout
for joy, O heavens;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice, O earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst into song, O mountains!<br>
For the LORD comforts his people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will have compassion on his afflicted
ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18651">14</sup> But
Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord has forgotten me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18652">15</sup> “Can
a mother forget the baby at her breast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have no compassion on the child she has
borne?<br>
Though she may forget,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not forget you!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18653">16</sup> See, I have
engraved you on the palms of my hands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your walls are ever before me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18654">17</sup> Your sons
hasten back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who laid you waste depart from you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18655">18</sup> Lift up your
eyes and look around;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all your sons gather and come to you.<br>
As surely as I live,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“you will wear them all as ornaments;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will put them on, like a bride.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18656">19</sup> “Though you
were ruined and made desolate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your land laid waste,<br>
now you will be too small for your people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who devoured you will be far away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18657">20</sup> The children
born during your bereavement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will yet say in your hearing,<br>
‘This place is too small for us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give us more space to live in.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18658">21</sup> Then you will
say in your heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Who bore me these?<br>
I was bereaved and barren;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was exiled and rejected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who brought these up?<br>
I was left all alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these—where have they come from?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18659">22</sup> This
is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, I will beckon to the Gentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will lift up my banner to the peoples;<br>
they will bring your sons in their arms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carry your daughters on their shoulders.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18660">23</sup> Kings will be
your foster fathers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their queens your nursing mothers.<br>
They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will lick the dust at your feet.<br>
Then you will know that I am the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who hope in me will not be
disappointed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18661">24</sup> Can
plunder be taken from warriors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or captives rescued from the fierce<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18661b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18662">25</sup> But
this is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, captives will be taken from
warriors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plunder retrieved from the fierce;<br>
I will contend with those who contend with you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your children I will save.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18663">26</sup> I will make
your oppressors eat their own flesh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be drunk on their own blood, as with
wine.<br>
Then all mankind will know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I, the LORD, am your Savior,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”</p>
