<h4>Jeremiah 52</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Fall of Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20278">1</sup> Zedekiah
was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20279">2</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD,
just as Jehoiakim had done. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20280">3</sup> It was because of the LORD’s anger that
all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust
them from his presence.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of
Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20281">4</sup> So in
the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth
month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem
with his whole army. They camped outside the city and built siege
works all around it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20282">5</sup> The city was kept under siege until the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20283">6</sup> By the
ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so
severe that there was no food for the people to eat. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20284">7</sup> Then the city wall was
broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at
night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s
garden, though the Babylonians<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-20284a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> were
surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20284b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20285">8</sup> but the Babylonian<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20285c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> army pursued King Zedekiah and
overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were
separated from him and scattered, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20286">9</sup> and he was captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah
in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20287">10</sup> There at
Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20288">11</sup> Then he put out
Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to
Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20289">12</sup> On
the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20290">13</sup> He set fire to
the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of
Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20291">14</sup> The whole Babylonian army
under the commander of the imperial guard broke down all the walls
around Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20292">15</sup> Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard
carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who
remained in the city, along with the rest of the
craftsmen<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20292d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and those who had gone over to
the king of Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20293">16</sup> But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of
the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and
fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20294">17</sup> The
Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the
bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all
the bronze to Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20295">18</sup> They also took away the pots, shovels,
wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles
used in the temple service. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20296">19</sup> The commander of the imperial guard
took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands,
dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of
pure gold or silver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20297">20</sup> The
bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls
under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for
the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20298">21</sup> Each of the pillars was
eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20298e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>; each was four fingers thick, and
hollow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20299">22</sup> The
bronze capital on top of the one pillar was five cubits<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20299f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> high and was decorated with a network
and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its
pomegranates, was similar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20300">23</sup> There were ninety-six pomegranates on
the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding
network was a hundred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20301">24</sup> The
commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest,
Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20302">25</sup> Of those still
in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and
seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief
officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty
of his men who were found in the city. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20303">26</sup> Nebuzaradan the commander took them all
and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20304">27</sup> There at Riblah, in the
land of Hamath, the king had them executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Judah went into captivity, away from her
land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20305">28</sup> This is
the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20306">29</sup> in
Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;832 people from Jerusalem;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20307">30</sup> in
his twenty-third year,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the
commander of the imperial guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 4,600 people in all.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoiachin Released</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20308">31</sup> In the
thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in
the year Evil-Merodach<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-20308g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> became
king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him
from prison on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20309">32</sup> He spoke
kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the
other kings who were with him in Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20310">33</sup> So Jehoiachin put aside his prison
clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s
table. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20311">34</sup> Day by
day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long
as he lived, till the day of his death.
