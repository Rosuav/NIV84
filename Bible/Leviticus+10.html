<h4>Leviticus 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Death of Nadab and Abihu</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2979">1</sup> Aaron’s
sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added
incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD,
contrary to his command. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2980">2</sup> So fire came out from the presence of the
LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2981">3</sup> Moses then said to Aaron,
“This is what the LORD spoke of when he said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Among those who approach me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will show myself holy;<br>
in the sight of all the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be honored.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron remained silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2982">4</sup> Moses
summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and
said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away
from the front of the sanctuary.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2983">5</sup> So they came and carried them, still in
their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2984">6</sup> Then
Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let
your hair become unkempt,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2984a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and do
not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD will be angry
with the whole community. But your relatives, all the house of
Israel, may mourn for those the LORD has destroyed by fire.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2985">7</sup> Do not leave the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting or you will die, because the LORD’s
anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2986">8</sup> Then
the LORD said to Aaron, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2987">9</sup> “You and your sons are not to drink wine
or other fermented drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting,
or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to
come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2988">10</sup> You must
distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean
and the clean, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2989">11</sup>
and you must teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has
given them through Moses.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2990">12</sup> Moses
said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take
the grain offering left over from the offerings made to the LORD by
fire and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, for it is
most holy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2991">13</sup> Eat
it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons’ share
of the offerings made to the LORD by fire; for so I have been
commanded. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2992">14</sup> But
you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was
waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially
clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your
share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2992b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2993">15</sup> The thigh that was presented and the
breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the
offerings made by fire, to be waved before the LORD as a wave
offering. This will be the regular share for you and your children,
as the LORD has commanded.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2994">16</sup> When
Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it
had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s
remaining sons, and asked, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2995">17</sup> “Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in
the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take
away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before
the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2996">18</sup> Since
its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten
the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2997">19</sup> Aaron
replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and
their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as this have
happened to me. Would the LORD have been pleased if I had eaten the
sin offering today?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2998">20</sup> When Moses heard this, he was
satisfied.</p>
