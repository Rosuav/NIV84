<h4>Lamentations 5</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20444">1</sup>
Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look, and see our disgrace.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20445">2</sup> Our inheritance
has been turned over to aliens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our homes to foreigners.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20446">3</sup> We have become
orphans and fatherless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our mothers like widows.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20447">4</sup> We must buy the
water we drink;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our wood can be had only at a price.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20448">5</sup> Those who
pursue us are at our heels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are weary and find no rest.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20449">6</sup> We submitted to
Egypt and Assyria<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get enough bread.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20450">7</sup> Our fathers
sinned and are no more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we bear their punishment.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20451">8</sup> Slaves rule
over us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is none to free us from their
hands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20452">9</sup> We get our
bread at the risk of our lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the sword in the desert.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20453">10</sup> Our skin is
hot as an oven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feverish from hunger.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20454">11</sup> Women have
been ravished in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and virgins in the towns of Judah.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20455">12</sup> Princes have
been hung up by their hands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elders are shown no respect.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20456">13</sup> Young men toil
at the millstones;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boys stagger under loads of wood.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20457">14</sup> The elders are
gone from the city gate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the young men have stopped their music.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20458">15</sup> Joy is gone
from our hearts;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our dancing has turned to mourning.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20459">16</sup> The crown has
fallen from our head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to us, for we have sinned!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20460">17</sup> Because of
this our hearts are faint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of these things our eyes grow dim<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20461">18</sup> for Mount
Zion, which lies desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with jackals prowling over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20462">19</sup> You,
O LORD, reign forever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your throne endures from generation to
generation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20463">20</sup> Why do you
always forget us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you forsake us so long?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20464">21</sup> Restore us to
yourself, O LORD, that we may return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renew our days as of old<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20465">22</sup> unless you
have utterly rejected us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are angry with us beyond measure.</p>
