<h4>Mark 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24867">1</sup> When the
Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and
Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24868">2</sup> Very early on
the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their
way to the tomb <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24869">3</sup>
and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the
entrance of the tomb?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24870">4</sup> But
when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large,
had been rolled away. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24871">5</sup> As they entered the tomb, they saw a
young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and
they were alarmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24872">6</sup> “Don’t
be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who
was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where
they laid him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24873">7</sup>
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you
into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24874">8</sup>
Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the
tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The earliest manuscripts and some other
ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9–20.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24875">9</sup> When
Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to
Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24876">10</sup> She went and told those
who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24877">11</sup> When they
heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not
believe it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24878">12</sup>
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while
they were walking in the country. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24879">13</sup> These returned and reported it to the
rest; but they did not believe them either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24880">14</sup> Later
Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them
for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those
who had seen him after he had risen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24881">15</sup> He
said to them, <font class='woj'>“Go into all the world and preach
the good news to all creation.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24882">16</sup> Whoever believes and is
baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be
condemned.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24883">17</sup> And these signs will accompany those
who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak
in new tongues;</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24884">18</sup> they will pick up snakes with their
hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at
all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get
well.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24885">19</sup> After
the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and
he sat at the right hand of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24886">20</sup> Then the disciples went out and
preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed
his word by the signs that accompanied it.</p>
