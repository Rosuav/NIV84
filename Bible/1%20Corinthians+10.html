<h4>1 Corinthians 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Warnings From Israel’s History</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28553">1</sup> For I do
not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our
forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed
through the sea. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28554">2</sup> They were all baptized into Moses in the
cloud and in the sea. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28555">3</sup> They all ate the same spiritual food
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28556">4</sup> and drank the
same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that
accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28557">5</sup> Nevertheless, God was not pleased
with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28558">6</sup> Now
these things occurred as examples<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28558a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> to
keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28559">7</sup> Do not be
idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat
down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan
revelry.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28559b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28560">8</sup> We should not commit sexual immorality,
as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them
died. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28561">9</sup> We should
not test the Lord, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28562">10</sup> And do not
grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying
angel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28563">11</sup> These
things happened to them as examples and were written down as
warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28564">12</sup> So, if you
think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28565">13</sup> No temptation
has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful;
he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when
you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can
stand up under it.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Idol Feasts and the Lord’s Supper</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28566">14</sup>
Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28567">15</sup> I speak to sensible
people; judge for yourselves what I say. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28568">16</sup> Is not the cup of thanksgiving for
which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is
not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28569">17</sup> Because there
is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of
the one loaf.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28570">18</sup>
Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices
participate in the altar? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28571">19</sup> Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered
to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28572">20</sup> No, but the sacrifices of
pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to
be participants with demons. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28573">21</sup> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the
Lord’s table and the table of demons. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28574">22</sup> Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s
jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Believer’s Freedom</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28575">23</sup>
“Everything is permissible”—but not everything is beneficial.
“Everything is permissible”—but not everything is constructive.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28576">24</sup> Nobody should
seek his own good, but the good of others.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28577">25</sup> Eat
anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of
conscience, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28578">26</sup>
for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28578c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28579">27</sup> If
some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat
whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28580">28</sup> But if anyone
says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat
it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience’
sake<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28580d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28581">29</sup> the other man’s conscience, I mean, not
yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another’s conscience?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28582">30</sup> If I take part
in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of
something I thank God for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28583">31</sup> So
whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
glory of God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28584">32</sup>
Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church
of God— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28585">33</sup> even
as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my
own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.</p>
