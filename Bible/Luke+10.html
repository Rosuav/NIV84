<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-two</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25357">1</sup> After
this the Lord appointed seventy-two<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25357a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> others
and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where
he was about to go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25358">2</sup> He told them, <font class='woj'>“The
harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the
harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest
field.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25359">3</sup> Go! I am sending you out like lambs
among wolves.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25360">4</sup> Do not take a purse or bag or sandals;
and do not greet anyone on the road.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25361">5</sup> “When you enter a house, first say,
‘Peace to this house.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25362">6</sup> If a man of peace is
there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to
you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25363">7</sup> Stay in that house, eating and drinking
whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not
move around from house to house.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25364">8</sup> “When you enter a town and are welcomed,
eat what is set before you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25365">9</sup> Heal the sick who are
there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25366">10</sup> But when you enter a town and are not
welcomed, go into its streets and say,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25367">11</sup> ‘Even
the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against
you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25368">12</sup> I tell you, it will be more bearable on
that day for Sodom than for that town.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25369">13</sup> “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been
performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago,
sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25370">14</sup> But it
will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for
you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25371">15</sup> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25371b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25372">16</sup> “He who listens to you listens to me;
he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him
who sent me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25373">17</sup> The
seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons
submit to us in your name.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25374">18</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25375">19</sup> I have given you authority to trample
on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy;
nothing will harm you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25376">20</sup> However, do not rejoice
that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25377">21</sup> At
that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said,
<font class='woj'>“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and
revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your
good pleasure.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25378">22</sup> “All things have been committed to me
by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no
one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the
Son chooses to reveal him.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25379">23</sup> Then
he turned to his disciples and said privately, <font class=
'woj'>“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25380">24</sup> For I tell you that many prophets and
kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear
what you hear but did not hear it.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Good Samaritan</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25381">25</sup> On one
occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he
asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25382">26</sup> “What is written in the Law?”</font> he
replied. <font class='woj'>“How do you read it?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25383">27</sup> He
answered: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength and with all your
mind’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25383c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>; and, ‘Love your neighbor as
yourself.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25383d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25384">28</sup> “You have answered correctly,”</font>
Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“Do this and you will
live.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25385">29</sup> But
he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my
neighbor?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25386">30</sup> In
reply Jesus said: <font class='woj'>“A man was going down from
Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They
stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him
half dead.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25387">31</sup> A priest happened to be going down the
same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other
side.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25388">32</sup> So too, a Levite, when he came to the
place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25389">33</sup> But a
Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw
him, he took pity on him.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25390">34</sup> He went to him and
bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man
on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25391">35</sup> The next day he took out two silver
coins<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25391e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look
after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for
any extra expense you may have.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25392">36</sup> “Which of these three do you think was
a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of
robbers?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25393">37</sup> The
expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus told him, <font class='woj'>“Go and do
likewise.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">At the Home of Martha and Mary</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25394">38</sup> As Jesus
and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a
woman named Martha opened her home to him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25395">39</sup> She had a sister called Mary, who
sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25396">40</sup> But Martha was distracted
by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and
asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the
work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25397">41</sup> “Martha, Martha,”</font> the Lord
answered, <font class='woj'>“you are worried and upset about many
things,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25398">42</sup> but only one thing is
needed.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25398f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> Mary has chosen what is better, and
it will not be taken away from her.”</font></p>
