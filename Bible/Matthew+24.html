<h5 class="passage-header">Signs of the End of the Age</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23956">1</sup> Jesus
left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to
him to call his attention to its buildings. <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23957">2</sup> “Do you
see all these things?”</font> he asked. <font class='woj'>“I tell
you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every
one will be thrown down.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23958">3</sup> As
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him
privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what
will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23959">4</sup> Jesus
answered: <font class='woj'>“Watch out that no one deceives
you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23960">5</sup> For many will come in my name, claiming,
‘I am the Christ,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23960a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>’ and will
deceive many.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23961">6</sup> You will hear of wars and rumors of
wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must
happen, but the end is still to come.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23962">7</sup> Nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will
be famines and earthquakes in various places.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23963">8</sup> All these
are the beginning of birth pains.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23964">9</sup> “Then you will be handed over to be
persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations
because of me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23965">10</sup> At that time many will turn away from
the faith and will betray and hate each other,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23966">11</sup> and many
false prophets will appear and deceive many people.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23967">12</sup> Because of the increase of wickedness,
the love of most will grow cold,</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23968">13</sup> but he
who stands firm to the end will be saved.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23969">14</sup> And this
gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a
testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23970">15</sup> “So when you see standing in the holy
place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23970b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> spoken of through the prophet
Daniel—let the reader understand—</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23971">16</sup> then let
those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23972">17</sup> Let no
one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the
house.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23973">18</sup> Let no one in the field go back to get
his cloak.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23974">19</sup> How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23975">20</sup> Pray
that your flight will not take place in winter or on the
Sabbath.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23976">21</sup> For then there will be great distress,
unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be
equaled again.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23977">22</sup> If those days had not been cut short,
no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will
be shortened.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23978">23</sup> At that time if anyone says to you,
‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe
it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23979">24</sup> For false Christs and false prophets
will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even
the elect—if that were possible.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23980">25</sup> See, I
have told you ahead of time.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23981">26</sup> “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is,
out in the desert,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner
rooms,’ do not believe it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23982">27</sup> For as lightning that
comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the
coming of the Son of Man.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23983">28</sup> Wherever there is a
carcass, there the vultures will gather.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23984">29</sup> “Immediately after the distress of
those days</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘the sun will be
darkened,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and the moon will not give its
light;</font><br>
<font class='woj'>the stars will fall from the sky,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and the heavenly bodies will be
shaken.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23984c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23985">30</sup> “At that time the sign of the Son of
Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will
mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the
sky, with power and great glory.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23986">31</sup> And he
will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather
his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the
other.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23987">32</sup> “Now learn this lesson from the fig
tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you
know that summer is near.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23988">33</sup> Even so, when you see all
these things, you know that it<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23988d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> is near,
right at the door.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23989">34</sup> I tell you the truth, this
generation<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23989e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> will certainly not pass away
until all these things have happened.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23990">35</sup> Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass
away.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Day and Hour Unknown</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23991">36</sup> “No one knows about that day or hour,
not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23991f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> but only the Father.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23992">37</sup> As it was in the days of Noah, so it
will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23993">38</sup> For in
the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the
ark;</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23994">39</sup> and they knew nothing about what would
happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it
will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23995">40</sup> Two men
will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23996">41</sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand
mill; one will be taken and the other left.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23997">42</sup> “Therefore keep watch, because you do
not know on what day your Lord will come.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23998">43</sup> But
understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time
of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would
not have let his house be broken into.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23999">44</sup> So you
also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour
when you do not expect him.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24000">45</sup> “Who then is the faithful and wise
servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his
household to give them their food at the proper time?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24001">46</sup> It will be good for that servant whose
master finds him doing so when he returns.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24002">47</sup> I tell
you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his
possessions.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24003">48</sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and
says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24004">49</sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow
servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24005">50</sup> The
master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect
him and at an hour he is not aware of.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24006">51</sup> He will
cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font></p>
