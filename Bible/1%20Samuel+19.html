<h4>1 Samuel 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Saul Tries to Kill David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7708">1</sup> Saul told
his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan
was very fond of David <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7709">2</sup> and warned him, “My father Saul is
looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow
morning; go into hiding and stay there. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7710">3</sup> I will go out and stand with my father in
the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell
you what I find out.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7711">4</sup>
Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him,
“Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged
you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7712">5</sup> He took his life in his
hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory
for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do
wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no
reason?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7713">6</sup> Saul
listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the LORD
lives, David will not be put to death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7714">7</sup> So
Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He
brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7715">8</sup> Once
more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines.
He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7716">9</sup> But an
evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7716a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> spirit from the LORD came upon
Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand.
While David was playing the harp, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7717">10</sup> Saul tried to pin him to the wall with
his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the
wall. That night David made good his escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7718">11</sup> Saul
sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the
morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run
for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7719">12</sup> So Michal let David down
through a window, and he fled and escaped. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7720">13</sup> Then Michal took an idol<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7720b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and laid it on the bed, covering
it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7721">14</sup> When
Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7722">15</sup> Then
Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to
me in his bed so that I may kill him.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7723">16</sup> But when the men entered, there was the
idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7724">17</sup> Saul
said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy
away so that he escaped?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get
away. Why should I kill you?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7725">18</sup> When
David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and
told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to
Naioth and stayed there. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7726">19</sup> Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth
at Ramah”; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7727">20</sup> so
he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets
prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit
of God came upon Saul’s men and they also prophesied. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7728">21</sup> Saul was told about it,
and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a
third time, and they also prophesied. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7729">22</sup> Finally, he himself left for Ramah and
went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, “Where are Samuel
and David?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7730">23</sup> So
Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon
him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7731">24</sup> He stripped off
his robes and also prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay that way
all that day and night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among
the prophets?”</p>
