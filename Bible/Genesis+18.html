<h4>Genesis 18</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Three Visitors</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-426">1</sup> The LORD
appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was
sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-427">2</sup> Abraham looked up
and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried
from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the
ground.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-428">3</sup> He said,
“If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-428a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> do not pass your servant by.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-429">4</sup> Let a little
water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest
under this tree. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-430">5</sup>
Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then
go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very well,” they answered, “do as you
say.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-431">6</sup> So
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get
three seahs<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-431b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of fine flour and knead it
and bake some bread.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-432">7</sup> Then he
ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a
servant, who hurried to prepare it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-433">8</sup> He then brought some curds and milk and
the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While
they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-434">9</sup> “Where
is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There, in the tent,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-435">10</sup> Then
the LORD<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-435c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> said, “I will surely return to you
about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a
son.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the
tent, which was behind him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-436">11</sup> Abraham and Sarah were already old and
well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-437">12</sup> So Sarah laughed
to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my
master<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-437d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> is old, will I now have this
pleasure?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-438">13</sup> Then
the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I
really have a child, now that I am old?’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-439">14</sup> Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will
return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a
son.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-440">15</sup> Sarah
was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Abraham Pleads for Sodom</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-441">16</sup> When the
men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham
walked along with them to see them on their way. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-442">17</sup> Then the LORD said, “Shall
I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-443">18</sup> Abraham will surely become a great and
powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-444">19</sup> For I have
chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household
after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and
just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has
promised him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-445">20</sup> Then
the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great
and their sin so grievous <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-446">21</sup> that I will go down and see if what they
have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I
will know.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-447">22</sup> The men
turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing
before the LORD.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-447e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-448">23</sup> Then Abraham approached him and said:
“Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-449">24</sup> What if there are fifty
righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not
spare<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-449f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> the place for the sake of the
fifty righteous people in it? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-450">25</sup> Far be it from you to do such a thing—to
kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the
wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-450g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> of all the earth do right?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-451">26</sup> The
LORD said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom,
I will spare the whole place for their sake.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-452">27</sup> Then
Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak
to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-453">28</sup> what if the number of the
righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city
because of five people?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will
not destroy it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-454">29</sup> Once
again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do
it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-455">30</sup> Then he
said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only
thirty can be found there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, “I will not do it if I find
thirty there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-456">31</sup> Abraham
said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what
if only twenty can be found there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not
destroy it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-457">32</sup> Then he
said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more.
What if only ten can be found there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not
destroy it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-458">33</sup> When
the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham
returned home.</p>
