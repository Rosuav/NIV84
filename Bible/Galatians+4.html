<h4>Galatians 4</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29117">1</sup> What I
am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no
different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29118">2</sup> He is subject
to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29119">3</sup> So also, when
we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of
the world. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29120">4</sup> But
when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman,
born under law, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29121">5</sup>
to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of
sons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29122">6</sup> Because
you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the
Spirit who calls out, “<i>Abba</i>,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29122a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
Father.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29123">7</sup> So you
are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has
made you also an heir.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Concern for the Galatians</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29124">8</sup> Formerly,
when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature
are not gods. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29125">9</sup>
But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that
you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you
wish to be enslaved by them all over again? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29126">10</sup> You are observing special days and
months and seasons and years! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29127">11</sup> I fear for you, that somehow I have
wasted my efforts on you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29128">12</sup> I
plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you.
You have done me no wrong. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29129">13</sup> As you know, it was because of an
illness that I first preached the gospel to you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29130">14</sup> Even though my illness
was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn.
Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were
Christ Jesus himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29131">15</sup> What has happened to all your joy? I
can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn
out your eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29132">16</sup> Have I now become your enemy by telling
you the truth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29133">17</sup> Those
people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want
is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29134">18</sup> It is fine to
be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and
not just when I am with you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29135">19</sup> My dear children, for whom I am again
in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29136">20</sup> how I wish I
could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed
about you!</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Hagar and Sarah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29137">21</sup> Tell me,
you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law
says? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29138">22</sup> For it
is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and
the other by the free woman. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29139">23</sup> His son by the slave woman was born in
the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the
result of a promise.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29140">24</sup> These
things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two
covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who
are to be slaves: This is Hagar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29141">25</sup> Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in
Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because
she is in slavery with her children. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29142">26</sup> But the Jerusalem that is above is
free, and she is our mother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29143">27</sup> For it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be glad, O barren woman,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who bears no children;<br>
break forth and cry aloud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who have no labor pains;<br>
because more are the children of the desolate woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than of her who has a husband.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29143b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29144">28</sup> Now
you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29145">29</sup> At that time the son born
in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the
Spirit. It is the same now. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29146">30</sup> But what does the Scripture say? “Get
rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will
never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s
son.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29146c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29147">31</sup> Therefore, brothers, we are not
children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</p>
