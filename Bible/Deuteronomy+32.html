<h4>Deuteronomy 32</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5760">1</sup> Listen,
O heavens, and I will speak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5761">2</sup> Let my teaching
fall like rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my words descend like dew,<br>
like showers on new grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like abundant rain on tender plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5762">3</sup> I will
proclaim the name of the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, praise the greatness of our God!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5763">4</sup> He is the Rock,
his works are perfect,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all his ways are just.<br>
A faithful God who does no wrong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upright and just is he.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5764">5</sup> They
have acted corruptly toward him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their shame they are no longer his
children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a warped and crooked generation.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5764a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5765">6</sup> Is this the way
you repay the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O foolish and unwise people?<br>
Is he not your Father, your Creator,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5765b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who made you and formed you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5766">7</sup>
Remember the days of old;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the generations long past.<br>
Ask your father and he will tell you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your elders, and they will explain to you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5767">8</sup> When the Most
High gave the nations their inheritance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he divided all mankind,<br>
he set up boundaries for the peoples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the number of the sons of
Israel.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5767c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5768">9</sup> For the LORD’s
portion is his people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob his allotted inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5769">10</sup> In a
desert land he found him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a barren and howling waste.<br>
He shielded him and cared for him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he guarded him as the apple of his eye,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5770">11</sup> like an eagle
that stirs up its nest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hovers over its young,<br>
that spreads its wings to catch them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carries them on its pinions.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5771">12</sup> The LORD alone
led him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no foreign god was with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5772">13</sup> He
made him ride on the heights of the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fed him with the fruit of the fields.<br>
He nourished him with honey from the rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with oil from the flinty crag,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5773">14</sup> with curds and
milk from herd and flock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with fattened lambs and goats,<br>
with choice rams of Bashan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the finest kernels of wheat.<br>
You drank the foaming blood of the grape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5774">15</sup>
Jeshurun<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5774d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> grew fat and kicked;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled with food, he became heavy and sleek.<br>
He abandoned the God who made him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rejected the Rock his Savior.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5775">16</sup> They made him
jealous with their foreign gods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and angered him with their detestable idols.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5776">17</sup> They sacrificed
to demons, which are not God—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods they had not known,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods that recently appeared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods your fathers did not fear.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5777">18</sup> You deserted
the Rock, who fathered you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you forgot the God who gave you birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5778">19</sup> The
LORD saw this and rejected them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he was angered by his sons and
daughters.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5779">20</sup> “I will hide my
face from them,” he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“and see what their end will be;<br>
for they are a perverse generation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children who are unfaithful.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5780">21</sup> They made me
jealous by what is no god<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and angered me with their worthless idols.<br>
I will make them envious by those who are not a people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make them angry by a nation that has no
understanding.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5781">22</sup> For a fire has
been kindled by my wrath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that burns to the realm of death<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5781e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> below.<br>
It will devour the earth and its harvests<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set afire the foundations of the
mountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5782">23</sup> “I
will heap calamities upon them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spend my arrows against them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5783">24</sup> I will send
wasting famine against them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consuming pestilence and deadly plague;<br>
I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5784">25</sup> In the street
the sword will make them childless;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their homes terror will reign.<br>
Young men and young women will perish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infants and gray-haired men.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5785">26</sup> I said I would
scatter them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blot out their memory from mankind,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5786">27</sup> but I dreaded
the taunt of the enemy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest the adversary misunderstand<br>
and say, ‘Our hand has triumphed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD has not done all this.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5787">28</sup> They
are a nation without sense,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no discernment in them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5788">29</sup> If only they
were wise and would understand this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and discern what their end will be!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5789">30</sup> How could one
man chase a thousand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or two put ten thousand to flight,<br>
unless their Rock had sold them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the LORD had given them up?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5790">31</sup> For their rock
is not like our Rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as even our enemies concede.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5791">32</sup> Their vine
comes from the vine of Sodom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the fields of Gomorrah.<br>
Their grapes are filled with poison,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their clusters with bitterness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5792">33</sup> Their wine is
the venom of serpents,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deadly poison of cobras.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5793">34</sup> “Have
I not kept this in reserve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sealed it in my vaults?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5794">35</sup> It is mine to
avenge; I will repay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due time their foot will slip;<br>
their day of disaster is near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their doom rushes upon them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5795">36</sup> The
LORD will judge his people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have compassion on his servants<br>
when he sees their strength is gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one is left, slave or free.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5796">37</sup> He will say:
“Now where are their gods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rock they took refuge in,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5797">38</sup> the gods who
ate the fat of their sacrifices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drank the wine of their drink offerings?<br>
Let them rise up to help you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them give you shelter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5798">39</sup> “See
now that I myself am He!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no god besides me.<br>
I put to death and I bring to life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wounded and I will heal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one can deliver out of my hand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5799">40</sup> I lift my hand
to heaven and declare:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As surely as I live forever,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5800">41</sup> when I sharpen
my flashing sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hand grasps it in judgment,<br>
I will take vengeance on my adversaries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and repay those who hate me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5801">42</sup> I will make my
arrows drunk with blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while my sword devours flesh:<br>
the blood of the slain and the captives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heads of the enemy leaders.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5802">43</sup>
Rejoice, O nations, with his people,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he will avenge the blood of his servants;<br>
he will take vengeance on his enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make atonement for his land and people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5803">44</sup> Moses
came with Joshua<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5803h"
title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> son of Nun and spoke all the
words of this song in the hearing of the people. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5804">45</sup> When Moses finished
reciting all these words to all Israel, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5805">46</sup> he said to them, “Take to heart all the
words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may
command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5806">47</sup> They are not
just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live
long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Moses to Die on Mount Nebo</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5807">48</sup> On that
same day the LORD told Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5808">49</sup> “Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount
Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am
giving the Israelites as their own possession. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5809">50</sup> There on the mountain that
you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just
as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his
people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5810">51</sup> This is
because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the
Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and
because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5811">52</sup> Therefore, you
will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land
I am giving to the people of Israel.”
