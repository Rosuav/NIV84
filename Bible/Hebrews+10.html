<h4>Hebrews 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30119">1</sup> The law
is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the
realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same
sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those
who draw near to worship. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30120">2</sup> If it could, would they not have stopped
being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for
all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30121">3</sup> But those
sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30122">4</sup> because it is impossible for the
blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30123">5</sup>
Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sacrifice and offering you did not
desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a body you prepared for me;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30124">6</sup> with burnt
offerings and sin offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were not pleased.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30125">7</sup> Then I said,
‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come to do your will, O God.’”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30125a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30126">8</sup> First
he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin
offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”
(although the law required them to be made). <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30127">9</sup> Then he said, “Here I am, I have come
to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30128">10</sup> And by that
will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30129">11</sup> Day
after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties;
again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take
away sins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30130">12</sup> But
when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins,
he sat down at the right hand of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30131">13</sup> Since that time he waits for his
enemies to be made his footstool, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30132">14</sup> because by one sacrifice he has made
perfect forever those who are being made holy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30133">15</sup> The
Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30134">16</sup> “This
is the covenant I will make with them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after that time, says the Lord.<br>
I will put my laws in their hearts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will write them on their minds.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30134b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30135">17</sup> Then
he adds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Their sins and lawless acts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remember no more.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30135c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30136">18</sup> And
where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice
for sin.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Call to Persevere</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30137">19</sup>
Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most
Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30138">20</sup> by a new and living way opened for us
through the curtain, that is, his body, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30139">21</sup> and since we have a great priest over
the house of God, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30140">22</sup> let us draw near to God with a sincere
heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to
cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed
with pure water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30141">23</sup> Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we
profess, for he who promised is faithful. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30142">24</sup> And let us consider how we may spur one
another on toward love and good deeds. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30143">25</sup> Let us not give up meeting together, as
some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one
another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30144">26</sup> If we
deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge
of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30145">27</sup> but only a fearful expectation of
judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30146">28</sup> Anyone who
rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of
two or three witnesses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30147">29</sup> How much more severely do you think a
man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under
foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant
that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30148">30</sup> For we know
him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30148d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> and again, “The Lord will judge
his people.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30148e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30149">31</sup> It is a dreadful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30150">32</sup>
Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when
you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30151">33</sup> Sometimes you
were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you
stood side by side with those who were so treated. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30152">34</sup> You sympathized with
those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your
property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and
lasting possessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30153">35</sup> So do
not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30154">36</sup> You need to
persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will
receive what he has promised. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30155">37</sup> For in just a very little while,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He who is coming will come and will not
delay.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30156">38</sup> But my
righteous one<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30156f"
title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> will live by faith.<br>
And if he shrinks back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be pleased with him.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30156g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30157">39</sup> But
we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those
who believe and are saved.</p>
