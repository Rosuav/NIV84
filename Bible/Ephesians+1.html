<h4>Ephesians 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29192">1</sup> Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the saints in Ephesus,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29192a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the faithful<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29192b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29193">2</sup> Grace
and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Spiritual Blessings in Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29194">3</sup> Praise be
to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29195">4</sup> For he chose us
in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in
his sight. In love <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29196">5</sup> he<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29196c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in
accordance with his pleasure and will— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29197">6</sup> to the praise of his glorious grace,
which he has freely given us in the One he loves. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29198">7</sup> In him we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the
riches of God’s grace <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29199">8</sup> that he lavished on us with all wisdom
and understanding. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29200">9</sup> And he<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29200d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> made
known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure,
which he purposed in Christ, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29201">10</sup> to be put into effect when the times
will have reached their fulfillment—to bring all things in heaven
and on earth together under one head, even Christ.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29202">11</sup> In
him we were also chosen,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29202e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> having
been predestined according to the plan of him who works out
everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29203">12</sup> in order that we, who
were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his
glory. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29204">13</sup> And you
also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the
gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him
with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29205">14</sup> who is a deposit guaranteeing our
inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s
possession—to the praise of his glory.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving and Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29206">15</sup> For this
reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and
your love for all the saints, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29207">16</sup> I have not stopped giving thanks for
you, remembering you in my prayers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29208">17</sup> I keep asking that the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the
Spirit<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29208f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> of wisdom and revelation, so that you
may know him better. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29209">18</sup> I pray also that the eyes of your heart
may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he
has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the
saints, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29210">19</sup> and
his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like
the working of his mighty strength, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29211">20</sup> which he exerted in Christ when he
raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the
heavenly realms, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29212">21</sup> far above all rule and authority, power
and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the
present age but also in the one to come. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29213">22</sup> And God placed all things under his
feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29214">23</sup> which is his
body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
