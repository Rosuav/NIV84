<h4>Romans 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Submission to the Authorities</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28253">1</sup> Everyone
must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no
authority except that which God has established. The authorities
that exist have been established by God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28254">2</sup> Consequently, he who rebels against the
authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those
who do so will bring judgment on themselves. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28255">3</sup> For rulers hold no terror for those
who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free
from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he
will commend you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28256">4</sup> For he is God’s servant to do you good.
But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for
nothing. He is God’s servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment
on the wrongdoer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28257">5</sup> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to
the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also
because of conscience.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28258">6</sup> This
is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants,
who give their full time to governing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28259">7</sup> Give everyone what you owe him: If you
owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then
respect; if honor, then honor.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Love, for the Day Is Near</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28260">8</sup> Let no
debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one
another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28261">9</sup> The
commandments, “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not
steal,” “Do not covet,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28261a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and
whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one
rule: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28261b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28262">10</sup> Love does no harm to its neighbor.
Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28263">11</sup> And
do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you
to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now
than when we first believed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28264">12</sup> The night is nearly over; the day is
almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on
the armor of light. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28265">13</sup> Let us behave decently, as in the
daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality
and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28266">14</sup> Rather, clothe yourselves
with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify
the desires of the sinful nature.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
