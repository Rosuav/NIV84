<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Gog</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21427">1</sup> The word
of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21428">2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Gog,
of the land of Magog, the chief prince of<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21428a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Meshech and Tubal; prophesy against
him <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21429">3</sup> and say:
‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, O Gog,
chief prince of<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21429b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Meshech and Tubal. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21430">4</sup> I will turn you around,
put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole army—your
horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large and
small shields, all of them brandishing their swords. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21431">5</sup> Persia, Cush<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21431c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and Put will be with them, all with
shields and helmets, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21432">6</sup> also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth
Togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations
with you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21433">7</sup> “‘Get
ready; be prepared, you and all the hordes gathered about you, and
take command of them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21434">8</sup> After many days you will be called to
arms. In future years you will invade a land that has recovered
from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the
mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been
brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21435">9</sup> You and all
your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing
like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21436">10</sup>
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On that day thoughts will
come into your mind and you will devise an evil scheme. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21437">11</sup> You will say, “I will
invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and
unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without
gates and bars. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21438">12</sup> I will plunder and loot and turn my
hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the
nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the
land.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21439">13</sup> Sheba
and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her
villages<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21439d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> will say to you, “Have you come to
plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver
and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much
plunder?”’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21440">14</sup>
“Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: ‘This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: In that day, when my people Israel are living
in safety, will you not take notice of it? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21441">15</sup> You will come from your place in the
far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on
horses, a great horde, a mighty army. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21442">16</sup> You will advance against my people
Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, O Gog, I
will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me
when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21443">17</sup>
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Are you not the one I spoke
of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel? At that
time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21444">18</sup> This is what
will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my
hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21445">19</sup> In my zeal and fiery
wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake
in the land of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21446">20</sup> The fish of the sea, the birds of the
air, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the
ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at
my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will
crumble and every wall will fall to the ground. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21447">21</sup> I will summon a sword
against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign LORD. Every
man’s sword will be against his brother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21448">22</sup> I will execute judgment upon him with
plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones
and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations
with him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21449">23</sup> And
so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself
known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am
the LORD.’</p>
