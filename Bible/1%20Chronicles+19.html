<h4>1 Chronicles 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Battle Against the Ammonites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10909">1</sup> In the
course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son
succeeded him as king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10910">2</sup> David thought, “I will show kindness to
Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So
David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning
his father.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When David’s men came to Hanun in the land of
the Ammonites to express sympathy to him, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10911">3</sup> the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, “Do
you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to
express sympathy? Haven’t his men come to you to explore and spy
out the country and overthrow it?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10912">4</sup> So Hanun seized David’s men, shaved
them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and
sent them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10913">5</sup> When
someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to
meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay
at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10914">6</sup> When
the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David’s
nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand
talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10914a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of silver to hire chariots and
charioteers from Aram Naharaim,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10914b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Aram
Maacah and Zobah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10915">7</sup> They hired thirty-two thousand chariots
and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who
came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from
their towns and moved out for battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10916">8</sup> On
hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting
men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10917">9</sup> The
Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance
to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in
the open country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10918">10</sup> Joab
saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so
he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them
against the Arameans. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10919">11</sup> He put the rest of the men under the
command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the
Ammonites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10920">12</sup>
Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to
rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will
rescue you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10921">13</sup> Be
strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of
our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10922">14</sup> Then
Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and
they fled before him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10923">15</sup> When the Ammonites saw that the
Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and
went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10924">16</sup> After
the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent
messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the
River,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10924c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> with Shophach the commander of
Hadadezer’s army leading them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10925">17</sup> When
David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the
Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines
opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in
battle, and they fought against him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10926">18</sup> But they fled before Israel, and David
killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of
their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their
army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10927">19</sup> When
the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel,
they made peace with David and became subject to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Arameans were not willing to help the
Ammonites anymore.</p>
