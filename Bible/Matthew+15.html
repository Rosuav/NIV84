<h4>Matthew 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Clean and Unclean</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23635">1</sup> Then some
Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and
asked, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23636">2</sup> “Why do
your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash
their hands before they eat!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23637">3</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“And why do you break the command of God
for the sake of your tradition?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23638">4</sup> For God
said, ‘Honor your father and mother’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23638a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and
‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to
death.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23638b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23639">5</sup> But you say that if a man
says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you might otherwise
have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23640">6</sup> he is not to ‘honor his
father<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23640c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>’ with it. Thus you nullify the word
of God for the sake of your tradition.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23641">7</sup> You
hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about
you:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23642">8</sup> “‘These people honor me with their
lips,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>but their hearts are far from
me.</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23643">9</sup> They worship me in vain;</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>their teachings are but rules
taught by men.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23643d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23644">10</sup> Jesus
called the crowd to him and said, <font class='woj'>“Listen and
understand.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23645">11</sup> What goes into a man’s mouth does not
make him ‘unclean,’ but what comes out of his mouth, that is what
makes him ‘unclean.’”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23646">12</sup> Then
the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the
Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23647">13</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“Every plant that my heavenly Father has
not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23648">14</sup> Leave
them; they are blind guides.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23648e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> If a
blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23649">15</sup> Peter
said, “Explain the parable to us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23650">16</sup> “Are you still so dull?”</font> Jesus
asked them. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23651">17</sup> “Don’t you see that whatever enters the
mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23652">18</sup> But the things that come out of the
mouth come from the heart, and these make a man ‘unclean.’</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23653">19</sup> For out of the heart come evil
thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false
testimony, slander.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23654">20</sup> These are what make a man ‘unclean’;
but eating with unwashed hands does not make him
‘unclean.’”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Faith of the Canaanite Woman</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23655">21</sup> Leaving
that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23656">22</sup> A Canaanite
woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from
demon-possession.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23657">23</sup> Jesus
did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him,
“Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23658">24</sup> He
answered, <font class='woj'>“I was sent only to the lost sheep of
Israel.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23659">25</sup> The
woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23660">26</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“It is not right to take the children’s
bread and toss it to their dogs.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23661">27</sup> “Yes,
Lord,” she said, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from
their masters’ table.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23662">28</sup> Then
Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“Woman, you have great faith!
Your request is granted.”</font> And her daughter was healed from
that very hour.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23663">29</sup> Jesus
left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a
mountainside and sat down. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23664">30</sup> Great crowds came to him, bringing the
lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid
them at his feet; and he healed them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23665">31</sup> The people were amazed when they saw
the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the
blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23666">32</sup> Jesus
called his disciples to him and said, <font class='woj'>“I have
compassion for these people; they have already been with me three
days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away
hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23667">33</sup> His
disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote
place to feed such a crowd?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23668">34</sup> “How many loaves do you have?”</font>
Jesus asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seven,” they replied, “and a few small
fish.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23669">35</sup> He
told the crowd to sit down on the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23670">36</sup> Then he took the seven loaves and the
fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to
the disciples, and they in turn to the people. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23671">37</sup> They all ate and were
satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of
broken pieces that were left over. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23672">38</sup> The number of those who ate was four
thousand, besides women and children. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23673">39</sup> After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he
got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.</p>
