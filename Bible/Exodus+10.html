<h4>Exodus 10</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plague of Locusts</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1779">1</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart
and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these
miraculous signs of mine among them <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1780">2</sup> that you may tell your children and
grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I
performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the
LORD.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1781">3</sup> So
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the
LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to
humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may
worship me. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1782">4</sup> If
you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country
tomorrow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1783">5</sup> They
will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They
will devour what little you have left after the hail, including
every tree that is growing in your fields. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1784">6</sup> They will fill your houses and those
of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your
fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they
settled in this land till now.’” Then Moses turned and left
Pharaoh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1785">7</sup>
Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare
to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their
God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1786">8</sup> Then
Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD
your God,” he said. “But just who will be going?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1787">9</sup> Moses
answered, “We will go with our young and old, with our sons and
daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to
celebrate a festival to the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1788">10</sup>
Pharaoh said, “The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with
your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1788a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1789">11</sup> No! Have only the men go; and worship
the LORD, since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses
and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1790">12</sup> And
the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that
locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in
the fields, everything left by the hail.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1791">13</sup> So
Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east
wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By
morning the wind had brought the locusts; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1792">14</sup> they invaded all Egypt and settled down
in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had
there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1793">15</sup> They covered
all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left
after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on
the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land
of Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1794">16</sup>
Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned
against the LORD your God and against you. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1795">17</sup> Now forgive my sin once more and pray
to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1796">18</sup> Moses
then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1797">19</sup> And the LORD changed the wind to a very
strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into
the Red Sea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1797b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> Not a locust was left
anywhere in Egypt. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1798">20</sup> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart,
and he would not let the Israelites go.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Plague of Darkness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1799">21</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that
darkness will spread over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1800">22</sup> So Moses
stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered
all Egypt for three days. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1801">23</sup> No one could see anyone else or leave
his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the
places where they lived.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1802">24</sup> Then
Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your
women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and
herds behind.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1803">25</sup> But
Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt
offerings to present to the LORD our God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1804">26</sup> Our livestock too must go with us; not a
hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in
worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not
know what we are to use to worship the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1805">27</sup> But
the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let
them go. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1806">28</sup>
Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not
appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1807">29</sup> “Just
as you say,” Moses replied, “I will never appear before you
again.”</p>
