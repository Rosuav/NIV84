<h4>Jeremiah 19</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19409">1</sup> This
is what the LORD says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take
along some of the elders of the people and of the priests
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19410">2</sup> and go out to
the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate.
There proclaim the words I tell you, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19411">3</sup> and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O
kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a
disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who
hears of it tingle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19412">4</sup> For they have forsaken me and made this
a place of foreign gods; they have burned sacrifices in it to gods
that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever
knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the
innocent. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19413">5</sup> They
have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire
as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor
did it enter my mind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19414">6</sup> So beware, the days are coming, declares
the LORD, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the
Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19415">7</sup> “‘In
this place I will ruin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19415a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the plans
of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before
their enemies, at the hands of those who seek their lives, and I
will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the
beasts of the earth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19416">8</sup> I will devastate this city and make it
an object of scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff
because of all its wounds. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19417">9</sup> I will make them eat the flesh of their
sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh during
the stress of the siege imposed on them by the enemies who seek
their lives.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19418">10</sup> “Then
break the jar while those who go with you are watching, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19419">11</sup> and say to them, ‘This is
what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city
just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They
will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19420">12</sup> This is what I
will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the
LORD. I will make this city like Topheth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19421">13</sup> The houses in Jerusalem and those of
the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the
houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry
hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19422">14</sup>
Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to
prophesy, and stood in the court of the LORD’s temple and said to
all the people, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19423">15</sup> “This is what the LORD Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on this city and
the villages around it every disaster I pronounced against them,
because they were stiff-necked and would not listen to my
words.’”</p>
