<h4>2 Chronicles 22</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ahaziah King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11646">1</sup> The
people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, king in
his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the
camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king
of Judah began to reign.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11647">2</sup>
Ahaziah was twenty-two<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11647a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> years
old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His
mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11648">3</sup> He too
walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged
him in doing wrong. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11649">4</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as
the house of Ahab had done, for after his father’s death they
became his advisers, to his undoing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11650">5</sup> He also followed their counsel when he
went with Joram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11650b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> son of Ahab king of Israel
to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans
wounded Joram; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11651">6</sup>
so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had
inflicted on him at Ramoth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11651c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> in his
battle with Hazael king of Aram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ahaziah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11651d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> son of
Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab
because he had been wounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11652">7</sup>
Through Ahaziah’s visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s
downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu
son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of
Ahab. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11653">8</sup> While
Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the
princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives, who had been
attending Ahaziah, and he killed them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11654">9</sup> He then went in search of Ahaziah, and
his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought
to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He was a
son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So
there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain
the kingdom.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Athaliah and Joash</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11655">10</sup> When
Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11656">11</sup> But
Jehosheba,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11656e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> the daughter of King
Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among
the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his
nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11656f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> the daughter of King Jehoram and
wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid the
child from Athaliah so she could not kill him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11657">12</sup> He remained hidden with
them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the
land.
