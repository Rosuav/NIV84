<h4>Ezra 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Ezra Comes to Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12175">1</sup> After
these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra
son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12176">2</sup> the son of Shallum, the
son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12177">3</sup> the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah,
the son of Meraioth, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12178">4</sup> the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi,
the son of Bukki, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12179">5</sup> the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas,
the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12180">6</sup> this Ezra came up from
Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which
the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him
everything he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12181">7</sup> Some of the
Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and
temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of
King Artaxerxes.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12182">8</sup> Ezra
arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the
king. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12183">9</sup> He had
begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month,
and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month,
for the gracious hand of his God was on him. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12184">10</sup> For Ezra had devoted himself to the
study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its
decrees and laws in Israel.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">King Artaxerxes’ Letter to Ezra</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12185">11</sup> This is
a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest
and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and
decrees of the LORD for Israel:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12186">12</sup>
<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12186a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Artaxerxes, king of kings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of
the God of heaven:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12187">13</sup> Now I
decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests
and Levites, who wish to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12188">14</sup> You are sent
by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and
Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your
hand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12189">15</sup>
Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the
king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose
dwelling is in Jerusalem, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12190">16</sup> together with all the silver and gold
you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the
freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of
their God in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12191">17</sup> With this money be sure to buy bulls,
rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink
offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your
God in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12192">18</sup> You
and your brother Jews may then do whatever seems best with the rest
of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12193">19</sup> Deliver to the
God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in
the temple of your God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12194">20</sup> And anything else needed for the temple
of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may provide
from the royal treasury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12195">21</sup> Now
I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to
provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, a teacher of the
Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12196">22</sup> up to a hundred talents<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12196b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of silver, a hundred
cors<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12196c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of wheat, a hundred
baths<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12196d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of wine, a hundred
baths<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12196e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> of olive oil, and salt without
limit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12197">23</sup>
Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with
diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be
wrath against the realm of the king and of his sons? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12198">24</sup> You are also to know that
you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of
the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants or
other workers at this house of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12199">25</sup> And
you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you
possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to
all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your
God. And you are to teach any who do not know them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12200">26</sup> Whoever does not obey the
law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by
death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12201">27</sup>
Praise be to the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put it into
the king’s heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in
Jerusalem in this way <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12202">28</sup> and who has extended his good favor to
me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful
officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took
courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.</p>
