<h4>1 Samuel 27</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David Among the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7932">1</sup> But David
thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the
hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of
the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere
in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7933">2</sup> So
David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish
son of Maoch king of Gath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7934">3</sup> David and his men settled in Gath with
Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two
wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of
Nabal. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7935">4</sup> When Saul
was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7936">5</sup> Then
David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a
place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may
live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with
you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7937">6</sup> So on
that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings
of Judah ever since. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7938">7</sup> David lived in Philistine territory a
year and four months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7939">8</sup> Now
David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites
and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in
the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7940">9</sup> Whenever David attacked an area, he did
not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys
and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7941">10</sup> When
Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say,
“Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or
“Against the Negev of the Kenites.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7942">11</sup> He did not leave a man or woman alive to
be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and
say, ‘This is what David did.’” And such was his practice as long
as he lived in Philistine territory. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7943">12</sup> Achish trusted David and said to
himself, “He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites,
that he will be my servant forever.”</p>
