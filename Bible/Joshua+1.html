<h4>Joshua 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD Commands Joshua</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5853">1</sup> After the
death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son
of Nun, Moses’ aide: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5854">2</sup> “Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you
and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the
land I am about to give to them—to the Israelites. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5855">3</sup> I will give you every place
where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5856">4</sup> Your territory will extend from the
desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the
Hittite country—to the Great Sea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-5856a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> on the
west. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5857">5</sup> No one
will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As
I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor
forsake you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5858">6</sup> “Be
strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to
inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5859">7</sup> Be strong and
very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses
gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you
may be successful wherever you go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5860">8</sup> Do not let this Book of the Law depart
from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be
careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous
and successful. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5861">9</sup>
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be
terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be
with you wherever you go.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5862">10</sup> So
Joshua ordered the officers of the people: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5863">11</sup> “Go through the camp and tell the
people, ‘Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will
cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the
LORD your God is giving you for your own.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5864">12</sup> But to
the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua
said, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5865">13</sup> “Remember
the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: ‘The LORD
your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.’
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5866">14</sup> Your wives,
your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses
gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully
armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your
brothers <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5867">15</sup> until
the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they
too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is
giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land,
which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan
toward the sunrise.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5868">16</sup> Then
they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do,
and wherever you send us we will go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5869">17</sup> Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we
will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was
with Moses. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5870">18</sup>
Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words,
whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong
and courageous!”</p>
