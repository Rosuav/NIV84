<h4>Job 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Job’s Second Test</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12893">1</sup> On
another day the angels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-12893a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> came
to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with
them to present himself before him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12894">2</sup> And the LORD said to Satan, “Where have
you come from?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming through
the earth and going back and forth in it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12895">3</sup> Then
the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There
is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who
fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity,
though you incited me against him to ruin him without any
reason.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12896">4</sup> “Skin
for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own
life. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12897">5</sup> But
stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will
surely curse you to your face.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12898">6</sup> The
LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you
must spare his life.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12899">7</sup> So
Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with
painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12900">8</sup> Then Job took a
piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among
the ashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12901">9</sup> His
wife said to him, “Are you still holding on to your integrity?
Curse God and die!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12902">10</sup> He
replied, “You are talking like a foolish<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12902b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> woman. Shall we accept good from
God, and not trouble?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this, Job did not sin in what he
said.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Job’s Three Friends</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12903">11</sup> When
Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and
Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come
upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by
agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12904">12</sup> When they saw
him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to
weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their
heads. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12905">13</sup> Then
they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No
one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering
was.
