<h4>Ephesians 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Children and Parents</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29323">1</sup> Children,
obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29324">2</sup> “Honor your father and
mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29325">3</sup> “that it may go well with
you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29325a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29326">4</sup>
Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in
the training and instruction of the Lord.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Slaves and Masters</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29327">5</sup> Slaves,
obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity
of heart, just as you would obey Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29328">6</sup> Obey them not only to win their favor
when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will
of God from your heart. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29329">7</sup> Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were
serving the Lord, not men, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29330">8</sup> because you know that the Lord will
reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or
free.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29331">9</sup> And
masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them,
since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in
heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Armor of God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29332">10</sup> Finally,
be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29333">11</sup> Put on the full armor of
God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29334">12</sup> For our
struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,
against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29335">13</sup> Therefore put
on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you
may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done
everything, to stand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29336">14</sup> Stand firm then, with the belt of truth
buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in
place, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29337">15</sup> and
with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel
of peace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29338">16</sup> In
addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you
can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29339">17</sup> Take the helmet of
salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29340">18</sup> And pray in
the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the
saints.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29341">19</sup> Pray
also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me
so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29342">20</sup> for which I am
an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as
I should.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29343">21</sup>
Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will
tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I
am doing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29344">22</sup> I am
sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we
are, and that he may encourage you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29345">23</sup> Peace
to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29346">24</sup> Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus
Christ with an undying love.</p>
