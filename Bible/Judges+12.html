Ephraim</span></h3>
<p><span class="text Judg-12-1"><span class=

forces, crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you
go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We’re
going to burn down your house over your head.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6872" class="text Judg-12-2"><sup class=

engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I
called, you didn’t save me out of their hands.</span> <span id=
"en-NIV1984-6873" class="text Judg-12-3"><sup class=
"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When I saw that you wouldn’t help, I took
my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and
the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class=

have you come up today to fight me?”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NIV1984-6874" class="text Judg-12-4"><sup class=
"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Jephthah then called together the men of
Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down
because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are renegades
from Ephraim and Manasseh. ”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6875"
class="text Judg-12-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The
Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and
whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men
of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied,
“No,”</span> <span id="en-NIV1984-6876" class=
"text Judg-12-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>they said, “All
right, say ‘Shibboleth.’” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could
not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at
the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed
at that time.</span></p>
