<h4>Song of Songs 5</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lover</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17600">1</sup> I have
come into my garden, my sister, my bride;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gathered my hyrrh with my spice.<br>
I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have drunk my wine and my milk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Friends</b></p>
Eat, O friends, and drink;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink your fill, O lovers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beloved</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17601">2</sup> I
slept but my heart was awake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! My lover is knocking:<br>
“Open to me, my sister, my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my dove, my flawless one.<br>
My head is drenched with dew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hair with the dampness of the night.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17602">3</sup> I have taken
off my robe—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must I put it on again?<br>
I have washed my feet—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must I soil them again?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17603">4</sup> My lover thrust
his hand through the latch-opening;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart began to pound for him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17604">5</sup> I arose to open
for my lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hands dripped with myrrh,<br>
my fingers with flowing myrrh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the handles of the lock.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17605">6</sup> I opened for my
lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but my lover had left; he was gone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart sank at his departure.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17605a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup><br>
I looked for him but did not find him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called him but he did not answer.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17606">7</sup> The watchmen
found me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they made their rounds in the city.<br>
They beat me, they bruised me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they took away my cloak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those watchmen of the walls!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17607">8</sup> O daughters of
Jerusalem, I charge you—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you find my lover,<br>
what will you tell him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him I am faint with love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Friends</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17608">9</sup> How is
your beloved better than others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most beautiful of women?<br>
How is your beloved better than others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you charge us so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beloved</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17609">10</sup> My
lover is radiant and ruddy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding among ten thousand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17610">11</sup> His head is
purest gold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hair is wavy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and black as a raven.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17611">12</sup> His eyes are
like doves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the water streams,<br>
washed in milk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mounted like jewels.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17612">13</sup> His cheeks are
like beds of spice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yielding perfume.<br>
His lips are like lilies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dripping with myrrh.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17613">14</sup> His arms are
rods of gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set with chrysolite.<br>
His body is like polished ivory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decorated with sapphires.<sup class='footnote'>[

</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17614">15</sup> His legs are
pillars of marble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set on bases of gold.<br>
His appearance is like Lebanon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choice as cedars.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17615">16</sup> His mouth is
sweetness itself;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is altogether lovely.<br>
This is my lover, this is my friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
