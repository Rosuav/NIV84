<h4>Philippians 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29347">1</sup> Paul
and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi,
together with the overseers<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29347a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and
deacons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29348">2</sup> Grace
and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Thanksgiving and Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29349">3</sup> I thank
my God every time I remember you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29350">4</sup> In all my prayers for all of you, I
always pray with joy <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29351">5</sup> because of your partnership in the
gospel from the first day until now, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29352">6</sup> being confident of this, that he who
began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the
day of Christ Jesus.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29353">7</sup> It is
right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in
my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming
the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29354">8</sup> God can testify how I long
for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29355">9</sup> And
this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in
knowledge and depth of insight, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29356">10</sup> so that you may be able to discern what
is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29357">11</sup> filled with
the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the
glory and praise of God.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Paul’s Chains Advance the Gospel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29358">12</sup> Now I
want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really
served to advance the gospel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29359">13</sup> As a result, it has become clear
throughout the whole palace guard<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29359b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and to
everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29360">14</sup> Because of my chains, most of the
brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God
more courageously and fearlessly.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29361">15</sup> It is
true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others
out of goodwill. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29362">16</sup> The latter do so in love, knowing that
I am put here for the defense of the gospel. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29363">17</sup> The former preach Christ out of
selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up
trouble for me while I am in chains.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-29363c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29364">18</sup> But what does
it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from
false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I
rejoice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29365">19</sup> for I know
that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus
Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my
deliverance.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29365d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29366">20</sup> I eagerly expect and hope that I will
in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now
as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by
death. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29367">21</sup> For to
me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29368">22</sup> If I am to go on living in the body,
this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do
not know! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29369">23</sup> I am
torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which
is better by far; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29370">24</sup> but it is more necessary for you that I
remain in the body. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29371">25</sup> Convinced of this, I know that I will
remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and
joy in the faith, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29372">26</sup> so that through my being with you again
your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29373">27</sup>
Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the
gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear
about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one
spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29374">28</sup> without being
frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to
them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and
that by God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29375">29</sup>
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to
believe on him, but also to suffer for him, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29376">30</sup> since you are going through the same
struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</p>
