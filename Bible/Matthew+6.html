<h4>Matthew 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Giving to the Needy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23284">1</sup>
<font class='woj'>“Be careful not to do your ‘acts of
righteousness’ before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will
have no reward from your Father in heaven.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23285">2</sup> “So when you give to the needy, do not
announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and on the streets, to be honored by men. I tell you the truth,
they have received their reward in full.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23286">3</sup> But when
you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your
right hand is doing,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23287">4</sup> so that your giving may be in secret.
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward
you.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23288">5</sup> “And when you pray, do not be like the
hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on
the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they
have received their reward in full.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23289">6</sup> But when
you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your
Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in
secret, will reward you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23290">7</sup> And when you pray, do not
keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard
because of their many words.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23291">8</sup> Do not be like them, for
your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23292">9</sup> “This, then, is how you should
pray:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘Our Father in
heaven,</font><br>
<font class='woj'>hallowed be your name,</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23293">10</sup> your kingdom come,</font><br>
<font class='woj'>your will be done</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>on earth as it is in
heaven.</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23294">11</sup> Give us today our daily
bread.</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23295">12</sup> Forgive us our debts,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>as we also have forgiven our
debtors.</font><br>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23296">13</sup> And lead us not into
temptation,</font><br>
<font class='woj'>but deliver us from the evil one.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23296a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23297">14</sup> For if you forgive men when they sin
against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23298">15</sup> But if you do not forgive men their
sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Fasting</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23299">16</sup> “When you fast, do not look somber as
the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they
are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward
in full.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23300">17</sup> But when you fast, put oil on your head
and wash your face,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23301">18</sup> so that it will not be obvious to
men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen;
and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward
you.</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">Treasures in Heaven</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23302">19</sup> “Do not store up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves
break in and steal.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23303">20</sup> But store up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where
thieves do not break in and steal.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23304">21</sup> For
where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23305">22</sup> “The eye is the lamp of the body. If
your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23306">23</sup> But if your eyes are bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is
darkness, how great is that darkness!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23307">24</sup> “No one can serve two masters. Either
he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to
the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and
Money.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Do Not Worry</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23308">25</sup> “Therefore I tell you, do not worry
about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body,
what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the
body more important than clothes?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23309">26</sup> Look at
the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in
barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much
more valuable than they?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23310">27</sup> Who of you by worrying
can add a single hour to his life<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23310b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23311">28</sup> “And why do you worry about clothes?
See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or
spin.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23312">29</sup> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in
all his splendor was dressed like one of these.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23313">30</sup> If that
is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you,
O you of little faith?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23314">31</sup> So do not worry, saying,
‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we
wear?’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23315">32</sup> For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23316">33</sup> But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as
well.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23317">34</sup> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,
for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble
of its own.</font></p>
