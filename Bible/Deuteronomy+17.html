<h4>Deuteronomy 17</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5366">1</sup> Do not
sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect
or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5367">2</sup> If a
man or woman living among you in one of the towns the LORD gives
you is found doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God in
violation of his covenant, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5368">3</sup> and contrary to my command has worshiped
other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the
stars of the sky, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5369">4</sup> and this has been brought to your
attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true
and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in
Israel, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5370">5</sup> take the
man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and
stone that person to death. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5371">6</sup> On the testimony of two or three
witnesses a man shall be put to death, but no one shall be put to
death on the testimony of only one witness. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5372">7</sup> The hands of the witnesses must be the
first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the
people. You must purge the evil from among you.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Law Courts</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5373">8</sup> If cases
come before your courts that are too difficult for you to
judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the
place the LORD your God will choose. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5374">9</sup> Go to the priests, who are Levites, and
to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and
they will give you the verdict. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5375">10</sup> You must act according to the decisions
they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do
everything they direct you to do. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5376">11</sup> Act according to the law they teach you
and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they
tell you, to the right or to the left. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5377">12</sup> The man who shows contempt for the judge
or for the priest who stands ministering there to the LORD your God
must be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5378">13</sup> All the people
will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again.
<h5 class="passage-header">The King</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5379">14</sup> When you
enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken
possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king
over us like all the nations around us,” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5380">15</sup> be sure to appoint over you the king the
LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers. Do
not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother Israelite.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5381">16</sup> The king,
moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or
make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD
has told you, “You are not to go back that way again.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5382">17</sup> He must not take many
wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate
large amounts of silver and gold.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5383">18</sup> When
he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a
scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the priests, who are
Levites. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5384">19</sup> It is
to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so
that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully
all the words of this law and these decrees <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5385">20</sup> and not consider himself better than
his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left.
Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom
in Israel.</p>
