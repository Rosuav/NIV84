<h4>Acts 1</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26914">1</sup> In my
former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do
and to teach <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26915">2</sup>
until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions
through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26916">3</sup> After his suffering, he
showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he
was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and
spoke about the kingdom of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26917">4</sup> On one occasion, while he was eating
with them, he gave them this command: <font class='woj'>“Do not
leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which
you have heard me speak about.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26918">5</sup> For John baptized
with<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26918a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> water, but in a few days you will be
baptized with the Holy Spirit.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26919">6</sup> So
when they met together, they asked him, “Lord, are you at this time
going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26920">7</sup> He
said to them: <font class='woj'>“It is not for you to know the
times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26921">8</sup> But you will receive power when the Holy
Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and
in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26922">9</sup> After
he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud
hid him from their sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26923">10</sup> They
were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when
suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26924">11</sup> “Men of Galilee,” they
said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus,
who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same
way you have seen him go into heaven.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26925">12</sup> Then
they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of
Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26925b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> from the
city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26926">13</sup> When
they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were
staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip
and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and
Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26927">14</sup> They all joined together constantly in
prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with
his brothers.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26928">15</sup> In
those days Peter stood up among the believers<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26928c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> (a group numbering about a hundred
and twenty) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26929">16</sup>
and said, “Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the
Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning
Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26930">17</sup> he was one of
our number and shared in this ministry.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26931">18</sup> (With
the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there
he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines
spilled out. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26932">19</sup>
Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field
in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26933">20</sup>
“For,” said Peter, “it is written in the book of Psalms,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘May his place be deserted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let there be no one to dwell in it,’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26933d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘May another take his place of
leadership.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26933e"
title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26934">21</sup>
Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been
with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26935">22</sup> beginning from
John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one
of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26936">23</sup> So
they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as
Justus) and Matthias. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26937">24</sup> Then they prayed, “Lord, you know
everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26938">25</sup> to take over
this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26939">26</sup> Then they cast
lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven
apostles.</p>
