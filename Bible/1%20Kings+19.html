<h4>1 Kings 19</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Elijah Flees to Horeb</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9389">1</sup> Now Ahab
told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all
the prophets with the sword. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9390">2</sup> So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to
say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this
time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9391">3</sup> Elijah
was afraid<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9391a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and ran for his life. When
he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9392">4</sup> while he himself
went a day’s journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat
down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough,
LORD,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9393">5</sup> Then he lay down
under the tree and fell asleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once an angel touched him and said,
“Get up and eat.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9394">6</sup> He looked around, and there by his head
was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He
ate and drank and then lay down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9395">7</sup> The
angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said,
“Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9396">8</sup> So he got up and ate and
drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty
nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9397">9</sup> There he went into a cave
and spent the night.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD Appears to Elijah</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the word of the LORD came to him: “What are
you doing here, Elijah?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9398">10</sup> He
replied, “I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The
Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars,
and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one
left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9399">11</sup> The
LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the
LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a great and powerful wind tore the
mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the
LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake,
but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9400">12</sup> After the earthquake came a fire, but
the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle
whisper. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9401">13</sup> When
Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and
stood at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing
here, Elijah?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9402">14</sup> He
replied, “I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The
Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars,
and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one
left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9403">15</sup> The
LORD said to him, “Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert
of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9404">16</sup> Also, anoint
Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of
Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9405">17</sup> Jehu will put to death any
who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any
who escape the sword of Jehu. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9406">18</sup> Yet I reserve seven thousand in
Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose
mouths have not kissed him.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Call of Elisha</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9407">19</sup> So Elijah
went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing
with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth
pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9408">20</sup> Elisha then
left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and
mother good-by,” he said, “and then I will come with you.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done
to you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9409">21</sup> So
Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and
slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat
and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow
Elijah and became his attendant.</p>
