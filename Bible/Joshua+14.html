<h4>Joshua 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Division of the Land West of the
Jordan</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6189">1</sup> Now these
are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land
of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the
heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6190">2</sup> Their inheritances were
assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the LORD had
commanded through Moses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6191">3</sup> Moses had granted the two-and-a-half
tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the
Levites an inheritance among the rest, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6192">4</sup> for the sons of Joseph had become two
tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the
land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks
and herds. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6193">5</sup> So
the Israelites divided the land, just as the LORD had commanded
Moses.
<h5 class="passage-header">Hebron Given to Caleb</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6194">6</sup> Now the
men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of
Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the LORD said
to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6195">7</sup> I was forty
years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh
Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report
according to my convictions, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6196">8</sup> but my brothers who went up with me made
the hearts of the people melt with fear. I, however, followed the
LORD my God wholeheartedly. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6197">9</sup> So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The
land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and
that of your children forever, because you have followed the LORD
my God wholeheartedly.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-6197a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6198">10</sup> “Now
then, just as the LORD promised, he has kept me alive for
forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel
moved about in the desert. So here I am today, eighty-five years
old! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6199">11</sup> I am still
as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous
to go out to battle now as I was then. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-6200">12</sup> Now give me this hill country that the
LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the
Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but,
the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6201">13</sup> Then
Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his
inheritance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6202">14</sup> So
Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever
since, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel,
wholeheartedly. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-6203">15</sup>
(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the
greatest man among the Anakites.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the land had rest from war.</p>
