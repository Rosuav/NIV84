<h4>Acts 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter Heals the Crippled Beggar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26987">1</sup> One day
Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at
three in the afternoon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26988">2</sup> Now a man crippled from birth was being
carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every
day to beg from those going into the temple courts. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26989">3</sup> When he saw Peter and John
about to enter, he asked them for money. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26990">4</sup> Peter looked straight at him, as did
John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26991">5</sup> So the man gave them his attention,
expecting to get something from them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26992">6</sup> Then
Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give
you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26993">7</sup> Taking him by the right
hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles
became strong. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26994">8</sup>
He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them
into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26995">9</sup> When all the
people saw him walking and praising God, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26996">10</sup> they recognized him as the same man who
used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they
were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to
him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter Speaks to the Onlookers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26997">11</sup> While
the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were
astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s
Colonnade. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26998">12</sup>
When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Men of Israel, why does this
surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or
godliness we had made this man walk? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26999">13</sup> The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed
him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though
he had decided to let him go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27000">14</sup> You disowned the Holy and Righteous One
and asked that a murderer be released to you. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27001">15</sup> You killed the author of life, but
God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27002">16</sup> By faith in the name of
Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’
name and the faith that comes through him that has given this
complete healing to him, as you can all see.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27003">17</sup> “Now,
brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27004">18</sup> But this is
how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets,
saying that his Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27004a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> would
suffer. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27005">19</sup>
Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out,
that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27006">20</sup> and that he may send the
Christ, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27007">21</sup> He must remain in heaven
until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised
long ago through his holy prophets. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27008">22</sup> For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will
raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you
must listen to everything he tells you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27009">23</sup> Anyone who does not listen to him will
be completely cut off from among his people.’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27009b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27010">24</sup>
“Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken,
have foretold these days. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27011">25</sup> And you are heirs of the prophets and
of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham,
‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be
blessed.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27011c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27012">26</sup> When God raised up his servant, he sent
him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your
wicked ways.”</p>
