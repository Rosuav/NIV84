<h4>Matthew 14</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">John the Baptist Beheaded</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23599">1</sup> At that
time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23600">2</sup> and he said to his
attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead!
That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23601">3</sup> Now
Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because
of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23602">4</sup> for John had been saying to him: “It is
not lawful for you to have her.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23603">5</sup> Herod wanted to kill John, but he was
afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23604">6</sup> On
Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for them and
pleased Herod so much <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23605">7</sup> that he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she asked. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23606">8</sup> Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give
me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23607">9</sup> The king was distressed,
but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her
request be granted <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23608">10</sup> and had John beheaded in the prison.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23609">11</sup> His head was
brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to
her mother. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23610">12</sup>
John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they
went and told Jesus.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23611">13</sup> When
Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a
solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot
from the towns. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23612">14</sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large
crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23613">15</sup> As
evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a
remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away,
so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23614">16</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“They do not need to go away. You give
them something to eat.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23615">17</sup> “We
have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they
answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23616">18</sup> “Bring them here to me,”</font> he
said. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23617">19</sup> And he
directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five
loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks
and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the
disciples gave them to the people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23618">20</sup> They all ate and were satisfied, and
the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that
were left over. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23619">21</sup> The number of those who ate was about
five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Walks on the Water</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23620">22</sup>
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on
ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23621">23</sup> After he had
dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.
When evening came, he was there alone, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23622">24</sup> but the boat was already a considerable
distance<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23622a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> from land, buffeted by the waves
because the wind was against it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23623">25</sup>
During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them,
walking on the lake. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23624">26</sup> When the disciples saw him walking on
the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried
out in fear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23625">27</sup> But
Jesus immediately said to them: <font class='woj'>“Take courage! It
is I. Don’t be afraid.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23626">28</sup>
“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the
water.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23627">29</sup> “Come,”</font> he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on
the water and came toward Jesus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23628">30</sup> But when he saw the wind, he was afraid
and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23629">31</sup>
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. <font class=
'woj'>“You of little faith,”</font> he said, <font class='woj'>“why
did you doubt?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23630">32</sup> And
when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23631">33</sup> Then those who were in
the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23632">34</sup> When
they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23633">35</sup> And when the men of that
place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding
country. People brought all their sick to him <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23634">36</sup> and begged him to let the sick just
touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were
healed.</p>
