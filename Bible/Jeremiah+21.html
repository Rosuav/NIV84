<h4>Jeremiah 21</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">God Rejects Zedekiah’s Request</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19442">1</sup> The word
came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him
Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah.
They said: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19443">2</sup>
“Inquire now of the LORD for us because Nebuchadnezzar<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19443a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> king of Babylon is attacking us.
Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so
that he will withdraw from us.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19444">3</sup> But
Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19445">4</sup> ‘This is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war
that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of
Babylon and the Babylonians<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19445b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> who are
outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this
city. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19446">5</sup> I myself
will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm
in anger and fury and great wrath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19447">6</sup> I will strike down those who live in
this city—both men and animals—and they will die of a terrible
plague. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19448">7</sup> After
that, declares the LORD, I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah,
his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague,
sword and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their
enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword; he
will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19449">8</sup>
“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the LORD says: See, I
am setting before you the way of life and the way of death.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19450">9</sup> Whoever stays
in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever
goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you
will live; he will escape with his life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19451">10</sup> I have determined to do this city harm
and not good, declares the LORD. It will be given into the hands of
the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19452">11</sup>
“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the
LORD; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19453">12</sup> O house
of David, this is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Administer justice every morning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rescue from the hand of his oppressor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one who has been robbed,<br>
or my wrath will break out and burn like fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the evil you have done—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn with no one to quench it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19454">13</sup> I am against
you, Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live above this valley<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the rocky plateau,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD—<br>
you who say, “Who can come against us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can enter our refuge?”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19455">14</sup> I will punish
you as your deeds deserve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
I will kindle a fire in your forests<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will consume everything around you.’”</p>
