<h4>Numbers 31</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Vengeance on the Midianites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4666">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4667">2</sup>
“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that,
you will be gathered to your people.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4668">3</sup> So
Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war
against the Midianites and to carry out the LORD’s vengeance on
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4669">4</sup> Send into
battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4670">5</sup> So twelve
thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were
supplied from the clans of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4671">6</sup> Moses sent them into battle, a thousand
from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest,
who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for
signaling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4672">7</sup> They
fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed
every man. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4673">8</sup> Among
their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of
Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4674">9</sup> The Israelites
captured the Midianite women and children and took all the
Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4675">10</sup> They burned all the towns where the
Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4676">11</sup> They took all the plunder
and spoils, including the people and animals, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4677">12</sup> and brought the captives, spoils and
plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly
at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from
Jericho.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4677a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4678">13</sup> Moses,
Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to
meet them outside the camp. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4679">14</sup> Moses was angry with the officers of the
army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who
returned from the battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4680">15</sup> “Have
you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4681">16</sup> “They were the ones who
followed Balaam’s advice and were the means of turning the
Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a
plague struck the LORD’s people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4682">17</sup> Now kill all the boys. And kill every
woman who has slept with a man, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4683">18</sup> but save for yourselves every girl who
has never slept with a man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4684">19</sup> “All
of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must
stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you
must purify yourselves and your captives. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4685">20</sup> Purify every garment as well as
everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4686">21</sup> Then
Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle,
“This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4687">22</sup> Gold, silver,
bronze, iron, tin, lead <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4688">23</sup> and anything else that can withstand
fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But
it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever
cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4689">24</sup> On the seventh day wash
your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the
camp.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Dividing the Spoils</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4690">25</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4691">26</sup>
“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community
are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4692">27</sup> Divide the
spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the
rest of the community. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4693">28</sup> From the soldiers who fought in the
battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five
hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep or goats.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4694">29</sup> Take this
tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as
the LORD’s part. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4695">30</sup> From the Israelites’ half, select one
out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats
or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for
the care of the LORD’s tabernacle.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4696">31</sup> So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as
the LORD commanded Moses.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4697">32</sup> The
plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was
675,000 sheep, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4698">33</sup>
72,000 cattle, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4699">34</sup>
61,000 donkeys <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4700">35</sup>
and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4701">36</sup> The
half share of those who fought in the battle was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;337,500 sheep, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4702">37</sup> of which the tribute for the LORD was
675;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4703">38</sup> 36,000
cattle, of which the tribute for the LORD was 72;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4704">39</sup> 30,500
donkeys, of which the tribute for the LORD was 61;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4705">40</sup> 16,000
people, of which the tribute for the LORD was 32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4706">41</sup> Moses
gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD’s part, as the
LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4707">42</sup> The
half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that
of the fighting men— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4708">43</sup> the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4709">44</sup> 36,000 cattle,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4710">45</sup> 30,500 donkeys
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4711">46</sup> and 16,000
people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4712">47</sup> From
the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty persons
and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the
Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD’s
tabernacle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4713">48</sup> Then
the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of
thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4714">49</sup> and said to him, “Your
servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one
is missing. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4715">50</sup> So
we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each
of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and
necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4716">51</sup> Moses
and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted
articles. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4717">52</sup> All
the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of
hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD
weighed 16,750 shekels.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-4717b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4718">53</sup> Each soldier
had taken plunder for himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4719">54</sup> Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted
the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of
hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for
the Israelites before the LORD.</p>
