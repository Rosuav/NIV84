<h4>Isaiah 14</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17930">1</sup> The
LORD will have compassion on Jacob;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once again he will choose Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will settle them in their own land.<br>
Aliens will join them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and unite with the house of Jacob.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17931">2</sup> Nations will
take them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring them to their own place.<br>
And the house of Israel will possess the nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s
land.<br>
They will make captives of their captors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rule over their oppressors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17932">3</sup> On the
day the LORD gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel
bondage, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17933">4</sup> you
will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the oppressor has come to an end!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How his fury<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-17933a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> has
ended!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17934">5</sup> The LORD has
broken the rod of the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scepter of the rulers,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17935">6</sup> which in anger
struck down peoples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with unceasing blows,<br>
and in fury subdued nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with relentless aggression.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17936">7</sup> All the lands
are at rest and at peace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they break into singing.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17937">8</sup> Even the pine
trees and the cedars of Lebanon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exult over you and say,<br>
“Now that you have been laid low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no woodsman comes to cut us down.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17938">9</sup> The
grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17938b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> below is all astir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to meet you at your coming;<br>
it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those who were leaders in the world;<br>
it makes them rise from their thrones—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those who were kings over the nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17939">10</sup> They will all
respond,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will say to you,<br>
“You also have become weak, as we are;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have become like us.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17940">11</sup> All your pomp
has been brought down to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with the noise of your harps;<br>
maggots are spread out beneath you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and worms cover you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17941">12</sup> How
you have fallen from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O morning star, son of the dawn!<br>
You have been cast down to the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who once laid low the nations!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17942">13</sup> You said in
your heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will ascend to heaven;<br>
I will raise my throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above the stars of God;<br>
I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the utmost heights of the sacred
mountain.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17942c"
title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17943">14</sup> I will ascend
above the tops of the clouds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make myself like the Most High.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17944">15</sup> But you are
brought down to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the depths of the pit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17945">16</sup> Those
who see you stare at you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they ponder your fate:<br>
“Is this the man who shook the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made kingdoms tremble,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17946">17</sup> the man who
made the world a desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who overthrew its cities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and would not let his captives go home?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17947">18</sup> All
the kings of the nations lie in state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each in his own tomb.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17948">19</sup> But you are
cast out of your tomb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a rejected branch;<br>
you are covered with the slain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with those pierced by the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who descend to the stones of the pit.<br>
Like a corpse trampled underfoot,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17949">20</sup> you will
not join them in burial,<br>
for you have destroyed your land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and killed your people.<br>
The offspring of the wicked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will never be mentioned again.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17950">21</sup> Prepare a
place to slaughter his sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sins of their forefathers;<br>
they are not to rise to inherit the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cover the earth with their cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17951">22</sup> “I
will rise up against them,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD Almighty.<br>
“I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her offspring and descendants,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17952">23</sup> “I will turn
her into a place for owls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and into swampland;<br>
I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD Almighty.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against Assyria</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17953">24</sup> The LORD
Almighty has sworn,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Surely, as I have planned, so it will be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as I have purposed, so it will stand.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17954">25</sup> I will crush
the Assyrian in my land;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on my mountains I will trample him down.<br>
His yoke will be taken from my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his burden removed from their shoulders.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17955">26</sup> This
is the plan determined for the whole world;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is the hand stretched out over all
nations.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17956">27</sup> For the LORD
Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it
back?</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy Against the Philistines</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17957">28</sup> This
oracle came in the year King Ahaz died:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17958">29</sup> Do
not rejoice, all you Philistines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the rod that struck you is broken;<br>
from the root of that snake will spring up a viper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its fruit will be a darting, venomous
serpent.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17959">30</sup> The poorest of
the poor will find pasture,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the needy will lie down in safety.<br>
But your root I will destroy by famine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will slay your survivors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17960">31</sup> Wail,
O gate! Howl, O city!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melt away, all you Philistines!<br>
A cloud of smoke comes from the north,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is not a straggler in its ranks.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17961">32</sup> What answer
shall be given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the envoys of that nation?<br>
“The LORD has established Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in her his afflicted people will find
refuge.”</p>
