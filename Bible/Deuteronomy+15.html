<h4>Deuteronomy 15</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Year for Canceling Debts</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5321">1</sup> At the end
of every seven years you must cancel debts. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5322">2</sup> This is how it is to be done: Every
creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow Israelite.
He shall not require payment from his fellow Israelite or brother,
because the LORD’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5323">3</sup> You may require
payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your brother
owes you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5324">4</sup>
However, there should be no poor among you, for in the land the
LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will
richly bless you, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5325">5</sup> if only you fully obey the LORD your God
and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5326">6</sup> For the LORD
your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to
many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many
nations but none will rule over you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5327">7</sup> If
there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the
land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or
tightfisted toward your poor brother. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5328">8</sup> Rather be openhanded and freely lend him
whatever he needs. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5329">9</sup> Be careful not to harbor this wicked
thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,”
so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give
him nothing. He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you
will be found guilty of sin. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5330">10</sup> Give generously to him and do so without
a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless
you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5331">11</sup> There will
always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be
openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in
your land.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Freeing Servants</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5332">12</sup> If a
fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, sells himself to you and serves
you six years, in the seventh year you must let him go free.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5333">13</sup> And when you
release him, do not send him away empty-handed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5334">14</sup> Supply him liberally from
your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to him as
the LORD your God has blessed you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5335">15</sup> Remember that you were slaves in Egypt
and the LORD your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this
command today.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5336">16</sup> But if
your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he
loves you and your family and is well off with you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5337">17</sup> then take an awl and push
it through his ear lobe into the door, and he will become your
servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5338">18</sup> Do not
consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his
service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that
of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything
you do.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Firstborn Animals</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5339">19</sup> Set apart
for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and
flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work, and do not
shear the firstborn of your sheep. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5340">20</sup> Each year you and your family are to eat
them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will
choose. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5341">21</sup> If an
animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you
must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5342">22</sup> You are to eat it in your own towns.
Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it
were gazelle or deer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5343">23</sup> But you must not eat the blood; pour it
out on the ground like water.</div>
