<h4>Leviticus 26</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Reward for Obedience</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3526">1</sup> “‘Do not
make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and
do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I
am the LORD your God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3527">2</sup>
“‘Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3528">3</sup> “‘If
you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3529">4</sup> I will send you
rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops and the
trees of the field their fruit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3530">5</sup> Your threshing will continue until grape
harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you
will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3531">6</sup> “‘I
will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will
make you afraid. I will remove savage beasts from the land, and the
sword will not pass through your country. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3532">7</sup> You will pursue your enemies, and they
will fall by the sword before you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3533">8</sup> Five of you will chase a hundred, and a
hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall
by the sword before you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3534">9</sup> “‘I
will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your
numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3535">10</sup> You will still be eating
last year’s harvest when you will have to move it out to make room
for the new. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3536">11</sup> I
will put my dwelling place<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3536a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> among
you, and I will not abhor you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3537">12</sup> I will walk among you and be your God,
and you will be my people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3538">13</sup> I am the LORD your God, who brought you
out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the
Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk
with heads held high.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Punishment for Disobedience</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3539">14</sup> “‘But if
you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3540">15</sup> and if you
reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my
commands and so violate my covenant, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3541">16</sup> then I will do this to you: I will bring
upon you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will
destroy your sight and drain away your life. You will plant seed in
vain, because your enemies will eat it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3542">17</sup> I will set my face against you so that
you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule
over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3543">18</sup> “‘If
after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for
your sins seven times over. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3544">19</sup> I will break down your stubborn pride
and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you
like bronze. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3545">20</sup>
Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not
yield its crops, nor will the trees of the land yield their
fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3546">21</sup> “‘If
you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will
multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3547">22</sup> I will send
wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children,
destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads
will be deserted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3548">23</sup> “‘If
in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but
continue to be hostile toward me, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3549">24</sup> I myself will be hostile toward you and
will afflict you for your sins seven times over. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3550">25</sup> And I will bring the sword
upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw
into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be
given into enemy hands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3551">26</sup> When I cut off your supply of bread, ten
women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will
dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be
satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3552">27</sup> “‘If
in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be
hostile toward me, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3553">28</sup> then in my anger I will be hostile
toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times
over. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3554">29</sup> You will
eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3555">30</sup> I will destroy
your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead
bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3556">31</sup> I will turn
your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will
take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3557">32</sup> I will lay
waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be
appalled. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3558">33</sup> I
will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and
pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie
in ruins. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3559">34</sup> Then
the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies
desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land
will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3560">35</sup> All the time that it lies desolate, the
land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you
lived in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3561">36</sup> “‘As
for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful
in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf
will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the
sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3562">37</sup> They will
stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even
though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand
before your enemies. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3563">38</sup> You will perish among the nations; the
land of your enemies will devour you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3564">39</sup> Those of you who are left will waste
away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also
because of their fathers’ sins they will waste away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3565">40</sup> “‘But
if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers—their
treachery against me and their hostility toward me, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3566">41</sup> which made me hostile
toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies—then
when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their
sin, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3567">42</sup> I will
remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my
covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3568">43</sup> For the land will be
deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate
without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my
laws and abhorred my decrees. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3569">44</sup> Yet in spite of this, when they are in
the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so
as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am
the LORD their God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3570">45</sup> But for their sake I will remember the
covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the
sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3571">46</sup> These
are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD
established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites
through Moses.</p>
