<h4>Isaiah 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Song of the Vineyard</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17741">1</sup> I will
sing for the one I love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a song about his vineyard:<br>
My loved one had a vineyard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a fertile hillside.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17742">2</sup> He dug it up
and cleared it of stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and planted it with the choicest vines.<br>
He built a watchtower in it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cut out a winepress as well.<br>
Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it yielded only bad fruit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17743">3</sup> “Now
you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge between me and my vineyard.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17744">4</sup> What more could
have been done for my vineyard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than I have done for it?<br>
When I looked for good grapes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why did it yield only bad?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17745">5</sup> Now I will tell
you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I am going to do to my vineyard:<br>
I will take away its hedge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it will be destroyed;<br>
I will break down its wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it will be trampled.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17746">6</sup> I will make it
a wasteland,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither pruned nor cultivated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and briers and thorns will grow there.<br>
I will command the clouds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to rain on it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17747">7</sup> The
vineyard of the LORD Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the house of Israel,<br>
and the men of Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the garden of his delight.<br>
And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for righteousness, but heard cries of
distress.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Woes and Judgments</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17748">8</sup> Woe to
you who add house to house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and join field to field<br>
till no space is left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you live alone in the land.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17749">9</sup> The
LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Surely the great houses will become
desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fine mansions left without occupants.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17750">10</sup> A
ten-acre<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17750a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> vineyard will produce only a
bath<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17750b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a homer<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-17750c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of
seed only an ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-17750d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of
grain.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17751">11</sup> Woe
to those who rise early in the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to run after their drinks,<br>
who stay up late at night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till they are inflamed with wine.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17752">12</sup> They have
harps and lyres at their banquets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tambourines and flutes and wine,<br>
but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no respect for the work of his hands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17753">13</sup> Therefore my
people will go into exile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for lack of understanding;<br>
their men of rank will die of hunger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their masses will be parched with thirst.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17754">14</sup> Therefore the
grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17754e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> enlarges its appetite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and opens its mouth without limit;<br>
into it will descend their nobles and masses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all their brawlers and revelers.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17755">15</sup> So man will be
brought low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mankind humbled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eyes of the arrogant humbled.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17756">16</sup> But the LORD
Almighty will be exalted by his justice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the holy God will show himself holy by his
righteousness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17757">17</sup> Then sheep
will graze as in their own pasture;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lambs will feed<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-17757f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> among
the ruins of the rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17758">18</sup> Woe
to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wickedness as with cart ropes,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17759">19</sup> to those who
say, “Let God hurry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him hasten his work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we may see it.<br>
Let it approach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we may know it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17760">20</sup> Woe
to those who call evil good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and good evil,<br>
who put darkness for light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and light for darkness,<br>
who put bitter for sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sweet for bitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17761">21</sup> Woe
to those who are wise in their own eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and clever in their own sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17762">22</sup> Woe
to those who are heroes at drinking wine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and champions at mixing drinks,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17763">23</sup> who acquit the
guilty for a bribe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but deny justice to the innocent.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17764">24</sup> Therefore, as
tongues of fire lick up straw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as dry grass sinks down in the flames,<br>
so their roots will decay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their flowers blow away like dust;<br>
for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spurned the word of the Holy One of
Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17765">25</sup> Therefore the
LORD’s anger burns against his people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand is raised and he strikes them down.<br>
The mountains shake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the dead bodies are like refuse in the
streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for all this, his anger is not turned
away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand is still upraised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17766">26</sup> He
lifts up a banner for the distant nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he whistles for those at the ends of the
earth.<br>
Here they come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swiftly and speedily!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17767">27</sup> Not one of
them grows tired or stumbles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one slumbers or sleeps;<br>
not a belt is loosened at the waist,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a sandal thong is broken.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17768">28</sup> Their arrows
are sharp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their bows are strung;<br>
their horses’ hoofs seem like flint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17769">29</sup> Their roar is
like that of the lion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they roar like young lions;<br>
they growl as they seize their prey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carry it off with no one to rescue.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17770">30</sup> In that day
they will roar over it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the roaring of the sea.<br>
And if one looks at the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will see darkness and distress;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the light will be darkened by the
clouds.</p>
