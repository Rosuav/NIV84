<font class='woj'>“I am the true vine, and my Father is the
gardener.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26691">2</sup> He cuts off every branch in me that
bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he
prunes<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26691a" title=

fruitful.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26692">3</sup> You are already clean because of the
word I have spoken to you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26693">4</sup> Remain in me, and I will
remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain
in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in
me.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26694">5</sup> “I am the vine; you are the branches. If
a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart
from me you can do nothing.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26695">6</sup> If anyone does not remain
in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such
branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26696">7</sup> If you remain in me and my words remain
in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26697">8</sup> This is to my Father’s glory, that you
bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26698">9</sup> “As the Father has loved me, so have I
loved you. Now remain in my love.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26699">10</sup> If you
obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed
my Father’s commands and remain in his love.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26700">11</sup> I have
told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be
complete.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26701">12</sup> My command is this: Love each other as
I have loved you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"

that he lay down his life for his friends.</font> <font class=

my friends if you do what I command.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26704">15</sup> I no
longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his
master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for
everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to
you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26705">16</sup> You did not choose me, but I chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last. Then
the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26706">17</sup> This is my command: Love each
other.</font></p>

that it hated me first.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26708">19</sup> If you belonged to the
world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to
the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the
world hates you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26709">20</sup> Remember the words I spoke to you: ‘No
servant is greater than his master.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26709b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> If they
persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my
teaching, they will obey yours also.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26710">21</sup> They
will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know
the One who sent me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26711">22</sup> If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no
excuse for their sin.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=

Father as well.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26713">24</sup> If I had not done among them what no
one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have
seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my
Father.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26714">25</sup> But this is to fulfill what is written
in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’<sup class=

send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from
the Father, he will testify about me.</font> <font class=

also must testify, for you have been with me from the
beginning.</font></p>
