<h4>John 18</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Arrested</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26776">1</sup> When he
had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the
Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he
and his disciples went into it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26777">2</sup> Now
Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often
met there with his disciples. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26778">3</sup> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a
detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests
and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and
weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26779">4</sup> Jesus,
knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked
them, <font class='woj'>“Who is it you want?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26780">5</sup> “Jesus
of Nazareth,” they replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“I am he,”</font> Jesus
said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26781">6</sup> When Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“I am he,”</font> they drew back and fell
to the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26782">7</sup> Again
he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Who is it you want?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26783">8</sup> “I told you that I am he,”</font> Jesus
answered. <font class='woj'>“If you are looking for me, then let
these men go.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26784">9</sup> This happened so that the words he had
spoken would be fulfilled: <font class='woj'>“I have not lost one
of those you gave me.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-26784a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26785">10</sup> Then
Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s
servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was
Malchus.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26786">11</sup> Jesus
commanded Peter, <font class='woj'>“Put your sword away! Shall I
not drink the cup the Father has given me?”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Taken to Annas</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26787">12</sup> Then the
detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials
arrested Jesus. They bound him <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26788">13</sup> and brought him first to Annas, who was
the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26789">14</sup> Caiaphas was
the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man
died for the people.
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter’s First Denial</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26790">15</sup> Simon
Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this
disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the
high priest’s courtyard, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26791">16</sup> but Peter had to wait outside at the
door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came
back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26792">17</sup> “You
are not one of his disciples, are you?” the girl at the door asked
Peter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, “I am not.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26793">18</sup> It
was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they
had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming
himself.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The High Priest Questions Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26794">19</sup>
Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and
his teaching.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26795">20</sup> “I have spoken openly to the
world,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“I always taught in
synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I
said nothing in secret.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26796">21</sup> Why question me? Ask
those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26797">22</sup> When
Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the
face. “Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he
demanded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26798">23</sup> “If I said something wrong,”</font>
Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“testify as to what is wrong. But
if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26799">24</sup> Then Annas sent him,
still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26799b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter’s Second and Third Denials</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26800">25</sup> As Simon
Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, “You are not one of his
disciples, are you?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He denied it, saying, “I am not.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26801">26</sup> One
of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear
Peter had cut off, challenged him, “Didn’t I see you with him in
the olive grove?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26802">27</sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that
moment a rooster began to crow.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Before Pilate</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26803">28</sup> Then the
Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor.
By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness
the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat
the Passover. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26804">29</sup>
So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you
bringing against this man?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26805">30</sup> “If
he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed
him over to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26806">31</sup>
Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own
law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we have no right to execute anyone,” the
Jews objected. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26807">32</sup>
This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the
kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26808">33</sup>
Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked
him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26809">34</sup> “Is that your own idea,”</font> Jesus
asked, <font class='woj'>“or did others talk to you about
me?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26810">35</sup> “Am I
a Jew?” Pilate replied. “It was your people and your chief priests
who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26811">36</sup> Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“My kingdom is not of this world. If it
were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But
now my kingdom is from another place.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26812">37</sup> “You
are a king, then!” said Pilate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answered, <font class='woj'>“You are
right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born,
and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.
Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26813">38</sup> “What
is truth?” Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews
and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26814">39</sup> But it is your custom for
me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do
you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26815">40</sup> They
shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had
taken part in a rebellion.</p>
