<h4>Revelation 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Seventh Seal and the Golden
Censer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30813">1</sup> When he
opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half
an hour.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30814">2</sup> And I
saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given
seven trumpets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30815">3</sup>
Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the
altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all
the saints, on the golden altar before the throne. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30816">4</sup> The smoke of the incense,
together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from
the angel’s hand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30817">5</sup> Then the angel took the censer, filled
it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there
came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an
earthquake.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Trumpets</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30818">6</sup> Then the
seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30819">7</sup> The
first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed
with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the
earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all
the green grass was burned up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30820">8</sup> The
second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge
mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea
turned into blood, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30821">9</sup> a third of the living creatures in the
sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30822">10</sup> The
third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a
torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the
springs of water— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30823">11</sup> the name of the star is
Wormwood.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30823a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> A third of the waters turned
bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become
bitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30824">12</sup> The
fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was
struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a
third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light,
and also a third of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30825">13</sup> As I
watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a
loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because
of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three
angels!”</p>
