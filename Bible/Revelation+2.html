church in Ephesus write:</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>These are the words of him
who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the
seven golden lampstands:</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30704">2</sup> I know your deeds, your
hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate
wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but
are not, and have found them false.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30705">3</sup> You have
persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not
grown weary.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30706">4</sup> Yet I hold this against you: You have
forsaken your first love.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30707">5</sup> Remember the height from
which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first.
If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand
from its place.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30708">6</sup> But you have this in your favor: You
hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also
hate.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30709">7</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the
Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the
right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of
God.</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">To the Church in Smyrna</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30710">8</sup> “To the angel of the church in Smyrna
write:</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>These are the words of him
who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life
again.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30711">9</sup> I know your afflictions and your
poverty—yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they
are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30712">10</sup> Do not be afraid of what you are about
to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to
test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be
faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown
of life.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30713">11</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt
at all by the second death.</font></p>

who has the sharp, double-edged sword.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30715">13</sup> I know
where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to
my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of
Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your
city—where Satan lives.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30716">14</sup> Nevertheless, I have a few things
against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of
Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating
food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual
immorality.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30717">15</sup> Likewise you also have those who hold
to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30718">16</sup> Repent
therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight
against them with the sword of my mouth.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30719">17</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give
some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a
new name written on it, known only to him who receives
it.</font></p>

Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are
like burnished bronze.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=

love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now
doing more than you did at first.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30722">20</sup> Nevertheless, I have this against you:
You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By
her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and
the eating of food sacrificed to idols.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30723">21</sup> I have
given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is
unwilling.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=

suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her
suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30725">23</sup> I will strike her children dead. Then
all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and
minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30726">24</sup> Now I say to the rest of you in
Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not
learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other
burden on you):</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30727">25</sup> Only hold on to what you have until I
come.</font></p>

to the end, I will give authority over the nations—</font></p>
