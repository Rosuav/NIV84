<h4>2 Kings 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoahaz King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9873">1</sup> In the
twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz
son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned
seventeen years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9874">2</sup>
He did evil in the eyes of the LORD by following the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he
did not turn away from them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9875">3</sup> So the LORD’s anger burned against
Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael
king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9876">4</sup> Then
Jehoahaz sought the LORD’s favor, and the LORD listened to him, for
he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9877">5</sup> The LORD
provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of
Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had
before. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9878">6</sup> But they
did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he
had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the
Asherah pole<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9878a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> remained standing in
Samaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9879">7</sup> Nothing
had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten
chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had
destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing
time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9880">8</sup> As for
the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his
achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9881">9</sup>
Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And
Jehoash<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9881b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoash King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9882">10</sup> In the
thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz
became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9883">11</sup> He did evil in
the eyes of the LORD and did not turn away from any of the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he
continued in them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9884">12</sup> As for
the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his
achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are
they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9885">13</sup> Jehoash rested
with his fathers, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash
was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9886">14</sup> Now
Elisha was suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash
king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. “My father!
My father!” he cried. “The chariots and horsemen of Israel!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9887">15</sup> Elisha
said, “Get a bow and some arrows,” and he did so. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9888">16</sup> “Take the bow in your
hands,” he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha
put his hands on the king’s hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9889">17</sup> “Open
the east window,” he said, and he opened it. “Shoot!” Elisha said,
and he shot. “The LORD’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory
over Aram!” Elisha declared. “You will completely destroy the
Arameans at Aphek.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9890">18</sup> Then
he said, “Take the arrows,” and the king took them. Elisha told
him, “Strike the ground.” He struck it three times and stopped.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9891">19</sup> The man of God
was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground
five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely
destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9892">20</sup> Elisha
died and was buried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country
every spring. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9893">21</sup>
Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a
band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb.
When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and
stood up on his feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9894">22</sup> Hazael
king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9895">23</sup> But the LORD
was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them
because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. To this day
he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his
presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9896">24</sup> Hazael
king of Aram died, and Ben-Hadad his son succeeded him as king.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9897">25</sup> Then Jehoash
son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the towns
he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times
Jehoash defeated him, and so he recovered the Israelite towns.</p>
