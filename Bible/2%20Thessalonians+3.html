<h4>2 Thessalonians 3</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Request for Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29664">1</sup> Finally,
brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread
rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29665">2</sup> And pray that we may be
delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29666">3</sup> But the Lord is
faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29667">4</sup> We have
confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do
the things we command. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29668">5</sup> May the Lord direct your hearts into
God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
<h5 class="passage-header">Warning Against Idleness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29669">6</sup> In the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep
away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to
the teaching<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29669a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> you received from us.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29670">7</sup> For you
yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not
idle when we were with you, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29671">8</sup> nor did we eat anyone’s food without
paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring
and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29672">9</sup> We did this,
not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to
make ourselves a model for you to follow. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29673">10</sup> For even when we were with you, we gave
you this rule: “If a man will not work, he shall not eat.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29674">11</sup> We
hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are
busybodies. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29675">12</sup>
Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle
down and earn the bread they eat. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29676">13</sup> And as for you, brothers, never tire of
doing what is right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29677">14</sup> If
anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special
note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel
ashamed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29678">15</sup> Yet
do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29679">16</sup> Now may
the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every
way. The Lord be with all of you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29680">17</sup> I,
Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the
distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29681">18</sup> The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</p>
