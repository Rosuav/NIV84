<h4>Numbers 32</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Transjordan Tribes</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4720">1</sup> The
Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw
that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4721">2</sup> So they came to
Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community,
and said, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4722">3</sup>
“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and
Beon— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4723">4</sup> the land
the LORD subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for
livestock, and your servants have livestock. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4724">5</sup> If we have found favor in your eyes,”
they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our
possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4725">6</sup> Moses
said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Shall your countrymen go to
war while you sit here? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4726">7</sup> Why do you discourage the Israelites from
going over into the land the LORD has given them? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4727">8</sup> This is what your fathers
did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4728">9</sup> After they went
up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged
the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4729">10</sup> The LORD’s
anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4730">11</sup> ‘Because they have not
followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old or
more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath
to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4731">12</sup> not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh
the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD
wholeheartedly.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4732">13</sup> The LORD’s anger burned against Israel
and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole
generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4733">14</sup> “And
here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your
fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4734">15</sup> If you turn
away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the
desert, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4735">16</sup> Then
they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for
our livestock and cities for our women and children. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4736">17</sup> But we are ready to arm
ourselves and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them
to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in
fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4737">18</sup> We will not
return to our homes until every Israelite has received his
inheritance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4738">19</sup> We
will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the
Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of
the Jordan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4739">20</sup> Then
Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves
before the LORD for battle, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4740">21</sup> and if all of you will go armed over the
Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before
him— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4741">22</sup> then when
the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free
from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will
be your possession before the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4742">23</sup> “But
if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and
you may be sure that your sin will find you out. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4743">24</sup> Build cities for your
women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have
promised.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4744">25</sup> The
Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as
our lord commands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4745">26</sup> Our children and wives, our flocks and
herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4746">27</sup> But your servants, every
man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD,
just as our lord says.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4747">28</sup> Then
Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son
of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4748">29</sup> He said to them, “If the
Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the
Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued
before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4749">30</sup> But if they do
not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession
with you in Canaan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4750">31</sup> The
Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the
LORD has said. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4751">32</sup>
We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the
property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4752">33</sup> Then
Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of
Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites
and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities
and the territory around them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4753">34</sup> The
Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4754">35</sup> Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4755">36</sup> Beth Nimrah and
Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4756">37</sup> And the
Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4757">38</sup> as well as Nebo and Baal
Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the
cities they rebuilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4758">39</sup> The
descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it
and drove out the Amorites who were there. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-4759">40</sup> So Moses gave Gilead to the
Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-4760">41</sup> Jair, a
descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them
Havvoth Jair.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-4760a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-4761">42</sup> And Nobah captured Kenath and its
surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.</p>
