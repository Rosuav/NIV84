done in Zion,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20238">25</sup> “I am

“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us,<br>

roar like young lions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they growl like lion cubs.<br>

are aroused,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will set out a feast for them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its roaring waves will cover her.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20256">43</sup> Her towns will
be desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a dry and desert land,<br>
a land where no one lives,<br>

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20257">44</sup> I will punish
Bel in Babylon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of ruler against ruler.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20260">47</sup> For the time
will surely come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I will punish the idols of Babylon;<br>
her whole land will be disgraced<br>

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20261">48</sup> Then heaven

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>

“Babylon must fall because of Israel’s slain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as the slain in all the earth<br>

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20265">52</sup> “But
days are coming,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“when I will punish her idols,<br>
and throughout her land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wounded will groan.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20266">53</sup> Even if
Babylon reaches the sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fortifies her lofty stronghold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will send destroyers against her,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20267">54</sup> “The

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20268">55</sup> The LORD will

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the King, whose name is the LORD
Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20271">58</sup> This

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nations’ labor is only fuel for the
flames.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20272">59</sup> This
is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of
Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah
king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20273">60</sup> Jeremiah had written on a
scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all
that had been recorded concerning Babylon. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-20274">61</sup> He said to Seraiah, “When you get to
Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20275">62</sup> Then say, ‘O LORD, you
have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor
animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20276">63</sup> When you finish reading
this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20277">64</sup> Then say, ‘So
will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will
bring upon her. And her people will fall.’”</p>
