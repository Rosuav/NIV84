is what the LORD says to his anointed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of<br>
to subdue nations before him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to strip kings of their armor,<br>
to open doors before him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that gates will not be shut:<br>

I will break down gates of bronze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cut through bars of iron.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18565">3</sup> I will give you
the treasures of darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riches stored in secret places,<br>
so that you may know that I am the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the God of Israel, who summons you by name.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18566">4</sup> For the sake of
Jacob my servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel my chosen,<br>
I summon you by name<br>

the rising of the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the place of its setting<br>
men may know there is none besides me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the LORD, and there is no other.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18569">7</sup> I form the
light and create darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring prosperity and create disaster;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, the LORD, do all these things.</p>

heavens above, rain down righteousness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the clouds shower it down.<br>
Let the earth open wide,<br>

to him who quarrels with his Maker,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds

Does the clay say to the potter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What are you making?’<br>
Does your work say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He has no hands’?<br>

is what the LORD says—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker:<br>
Concerning things to come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do you question me about my children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or give me orders about the work of my hands?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18574">12</sup> It is I who
made the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and created mankind upon it.<br>
My own hands stretched out the heavens;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marshaled their starry hosts.<br>

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18576">14</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>

Cush,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18576c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup><br>

they will come over to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will be yours;<br>
they will trudge behind you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming over to you in chains.<br>
They will bow down before you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plead with you, saying,<br>
‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no other god.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18577">15</sup> Truly
you are a God who hides himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God and Savior of Israel.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18578">16</sup> All the makers
of idols will be put to shame and disgraced;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will go off into disgrace together.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18579">17</sup> But Israel
will be saved by the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with an everlasting salvation;<br>
you will never be put to shame or disgraced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ages everlasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18580">18</sup> For
this is what the LORD says—<br>
he who created the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is God;<br>
he who fashioned and made the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he founded it;<br>
he did not create it to be empty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but formed it to be inhabited—<br>
he says:<br>
“I am the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is no other.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18581">19</sup> I have not
spoken in secret,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from somewhere in a land of darkness;<br>
I have not said to Jacob’s descendants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Seek me in vain.’<br>
I, the LORD, speak the truth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare what is right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18582">20</sup>
“Gather together and come;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assemble, you fugitives from the nations.<br>
Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who pray to gods that cannot save.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18583">21</sup> Declare what
is to be, present it—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them take counsel together.<br>
Who foretold this long ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who declared it from the distant past?<br>
Was it not I, the LORD?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is no God apart from me,<br>
a righteous God and a Savior;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none but me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18584">22</sup> “Turn
to me and be saved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all you ends of the earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am God, and there is no other.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18585">23</sup> By myself I
have sworn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my mouth has uttered in all integrity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a word that will not be revoked:<br>
Before me every knee will bow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by me every tongue will swear.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18586">24</sup> They will say
of me, ‘In the LORD alone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are righteousness and strength.’”<br>
All who have raged against him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come to him and be put to shame.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18587">25</sup> But in the
LORD all the descendants of Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be found righteous and will exult.</p>
