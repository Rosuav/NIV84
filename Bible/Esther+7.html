<h4>Esther 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Haman Hanged</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12809">1</sup> So the
king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12810">2</sup> and as they were drinking
wine on that second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what
is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even
up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12811">3</sup> Then
Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, O king, and
if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life—this is my petition.
And spare my people—this is my request. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12812">4</sup> For I and my people have been sold for
destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we had merely been
sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no
such distress would justify disturbing the king.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12812a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12813">5</sup> King
Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is the man who has
dared to do such a thing?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12814">6</sup> Esther
said, “The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Haman was terrified before the king and
queen. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12815">7</sup> The king
got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace
garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his
fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12816">8</sup> Just
as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall,
Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the
queen while she is with me in the house?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the word left the king’s mouth,
they covered Haman’s face. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12817">9</sup> Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs
attending the king, said, “A gallows seventy-five feet<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12817b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> high stands by Haman’s house. He
had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king said, “Hang him on it!” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12818">10</sup> So they hanged Haman on
the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s fury
subsided.</p>
