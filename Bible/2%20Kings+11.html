<h4>2 Kings 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Athaliah and Joash</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9831">1</sup> When
Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
proceeded to destroy the whole royal family. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9832">2</sup> But Jehosheba, the daughter of King
Jehoram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9832a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash
son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who
were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom
to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9833">3</sup> He remained hidden with his
nurse at the temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled
the land.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9834">4</sup> In the
seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a
hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at
the temple of the LORD. He made a covenant with them and put them
under oath at the temple of the LORD. Then he showed them the
king’s son. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9835">5</sup> He
commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: You who are in
the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath—a third
of you guarding the royal palace, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9836">6</sup> a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at
the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple—
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9837">7</sup> and you who are
in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are
all to guard the temple for the king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9838">8</sup> Station yourselves around the king, each
man with his weapon in his hand. Anyone who approaches your
ranks<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9838b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> must be put to death. Stay close
to the king wherever he goes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9839">9</sup> The
commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest
ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the
Sabbath and those who were going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the
priest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9840">10</sup> Then he
gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to
King David and that were in the temple of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9841">11</sup> The guards, each with his
weapon in his hand, stationed themselves around the king—near the
altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the
temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9842">12</sup>
Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; he
presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king.
They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted,
“Long live the king!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9843">13</sup> When
Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she
went to the people at the temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9844">14</sup> She looked and there was the king,
standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the
trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land
were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes
and called out, “Treason! Treason!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9845">15</sup>
Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred,
who were in charge of the troops: “Bring her out between the
ranks<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9845c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and put to the sword anyone who
follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to
death in the temple of the LORD.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9846">16</sup> So they seized her as she reached the
place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was
put to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9847">17</sup>
Jehoiada then made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
people that they would be the LORD’s people. He also made a
covenant between the king and the people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9848">18</sup> All the people of the land went to the
temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols
to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the
altars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the
temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9849">19</sup> He took with him the commanders of
hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land,
and together they brought the king down from the temple of the LORD
and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the
guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9850">20</sup> and all the
people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because
Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9851">21</sup>
Joash<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9851d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> was seven years old when he began
to reign.</p>
