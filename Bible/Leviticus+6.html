<h4>Leviticus 6</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2851">1</sup> The
LORD said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2852">2</sup> “If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the
LORD by deceiving his neighbor about something entrusted to him or
left in his care or stolen, or if he cheats him, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2853">3</sup> or if he finds lost
property and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or if he
commits any such sin that people may do— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2854">4</sup> when he thus sins and becomes guilty, he
must return what he has stolen or taken by extortion, or what was
entrusted to him, or the lost property he found, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2855">5</sup> or whatever it was he swore
falsely about. He must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the
value to it and give it all to the owner on the day he presents his
guilt offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2856">6</sup>
And as a penalty he must bring to the priest, that is, to the LORD,
his guilt offering, a ram from the flock, one without defect and of
the proper value. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2857">7</sup> In this way the priest will make
atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any
of these things he did that made him guilty.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Burnt Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2858">8</sup> The LORD
said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2859">9</sup>
“Give Aaron and his sons this command: ‘These are the regulations
for the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the
altar hearth throughout the night, till morning, and the fire must
be kept burning on the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2860">10</sup> The priest shall then put on his linen
clothes, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall
remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed
on the altar and place them beside the altar. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2861">11</sup> Then he is to take off these clothes
and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place
that is ceremonially clean. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2862">12</sup> The fire on the altar must be kept
burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add
firewood and arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the
fat of the fellowship offerings<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2862a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> on it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2863">13</sup> The fire must
be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Grain Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2864">14</sup> “‘These
are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to
bring it before the LORD, in front of the altar. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2865">15</sup> The priest is to take a
handful of fine flour and oil, together with all the incense on the
grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as an
aroma pleasing to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2866">16</sup> Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest of
it, but it is to be eaten without yeast in a holy place; they are
to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2867">17</sup> It must not be baked with
yeast; I have given it as their share of the offerings made to me
by fire. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most
holy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2868">18</sup> Any male
descendant of Aaron may eat it. It is his regular share of the
offerings made to the LORD by fire for the generations to come.
Whatever touches them will become holy.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2868b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2869">19</sup> The
LORD also said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2870">20</sup> “This is the offering Aaron and his sons
are to bring to the LORD on the day he<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2870c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> is anointed: a tenth of an
ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2870d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of fine flour as a regular grain
offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2871">21</sup> Prepare it with
oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain
offering broken<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2871e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> in pieces as an aroma
pleasing to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2872">22</sup> The son who is to succeed him as
anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the LORD’s regular share
and is to be burned completely. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2873">23</sup> Every grain offering of a priest shall
be burned completely; it must not be eaten.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Sin Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2874">24</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2875">25</sup>
“Say to Aaron and his sons: ‘These are the regulations for the sin
offering: The sin offering is to be slaughtered before the LORD in
the place the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2876">26</sup> The priest who
offers it shall eat it; it is to be eaten in a holy place, in the
courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2877">27</sup> Whatever touches any of the flesh will
become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you
must wash it in a holy place. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2878">28</sup> The clay pot the meat is cooked in must
be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot is to be
scoured and rinsed with water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2879">29</sup> Any male in a priest’s family may eat
it; it is most holy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2880">30</sup> But any sin offering whose blood is
brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy
Place must not be eaten; it must be burned.
