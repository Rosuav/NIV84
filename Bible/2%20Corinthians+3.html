<h4>2 Corinthians 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28827">1</sup> Are we
beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some
people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28828">2</sup> You yourselves are our
letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28829">3</sup> You show that
you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written
not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28830">4</sup> Such
confidence as this is ours through Christ before God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28831">5</sup> Not that we are competent
in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence
comes from God. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28832">6</sup>
He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the
letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit
gives life.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Glory of the New Covenant</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28833">7</sup> Now if
the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on
stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look
steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though
it was, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28834">8</sup> will
not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28835">9</sup> If the ministry that
condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry
that brings righteousness! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28836">10</sup> For what was glorious has no glory now
in comparison with the surpassing glory. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28837">11</sup> And if what was fading away came with
glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28838">12</sup>
Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28839">13</sup> We are not like Moses,
who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from
gazing at it while the radiance was fading away. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28840">14</sup> But their minds were made
dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant
is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it
taken away. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28841">15</sup>
Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28842">16</sup> But whenever
anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28843">17</sup> Now the Lord is the
Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28844">18</sup> And we, who
with unveiled faces all reflect<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28844a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> the
Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with
ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the
Spirit.</p>
