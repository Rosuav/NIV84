<h5 class="passage-header">What Must Be Taught to Various
Groups</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29894">1</sup> You must
teach what is in accord with sound doctrine. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-29895">2</sup> Teach the older men to be temperate,
worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and
in endurance.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29896">3</sup>
Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they
live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach
what is good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29897">4</sup>
Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and
children, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29898">5</sup> to be
self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be
subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of
God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29899">6</sup>
Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29900">7</sup> In everything
set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show
integrity, seriousness <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29901">8</sup> and soundness of speech that cannot be
condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they
have nothing bad to say about us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29902">9</sup> Teach
slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to
please them, not to talk back to them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29903">10</sup> and not to steal from them, but to show
that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make
the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29904">11</sup> For
the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29905">12</sup> It teaches us
to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live
self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29906">13</sup> while we wait
for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and
Savior, Jesus Christ, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-29907">14</sup> who gave himself for us to redeem us
from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his
very own, eager to do what is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29908">15</sup>
These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke
with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</p>
