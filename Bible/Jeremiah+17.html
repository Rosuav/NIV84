<h4>Jeremiah 17</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19359">1</sup>
“Judah’s sin is engraved with an iron tool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inscribed with a flint point,<br>
on the tablets of their hearts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the horns of their altars.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19360">2</sup> Even their
children remember<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their altars and Asherah poles<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19360a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup><br>
beside the spreading trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the high hills.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19361">3</sup> My mountain in
the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19361b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> wealth
and all your treasures<br>
I will give away as plunder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together with your high places,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of sin throughout your country.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19362">4</sup> Through your
own fault you will lose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inheritance I gave you.<br>
I will enslave you to your enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a land you do not know,<br>
for you have kindled my anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it will burn forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19363">5</sup> This
is what the LORD says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cursed is the one who trusts in man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who depends on flesh for his strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose heart turns away from the LORD.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19364">6</sup> He will be like
a bush in the wastelands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not see prosperity when it comes.<br>
He will dwell in the parched places of the desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a salt land where no one lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19365">7</sup> “But
blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose confidence is in him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19366">8</sup> He will be like
a tree planted by the water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that sends out its roots by the stream.<br>
It does not fear when heat comes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its leaves are always green.<br>
It has no worries in a year of drought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and never fails to bear fruit.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19367">9</sup> The
heart is deceitful above all things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and beyond cure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can understand it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19368">10</sup> “I
the LORD search the heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and examine the mind,<br>
to reward a man according to his conduct,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to what his deeds deserve.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19369">11</sup> Like
a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the man who gains riches by unjust means.<br>
When his life is half gone, they will desert him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the end he will prove to be a fool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19370">12</sup> A
glorious throne, exalted from the beginning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the place of our sanctuary.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19371">13</sup> O LORD, the
hope of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who forsake you will be put to shame.<br>
Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have forsaken the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spring of living water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19372">14</sup> Heal
me, O LORD, and I will be healed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save me and I will be saved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are the one I praise.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19373">15</sup> They keep
saying to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where is the word of the LORD?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it now be fulfilled!”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19374">16</sup> I have not run
away from being your shepherd;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you know I have not desired the day of
despair.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What passes my lips is open before you.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19375">17</sup> Do not be a
terror to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are my refuge in the day of disaster.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19376">18</sup> Let my
persecutors be put to shame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but keep me from shame;<br>
let them be terrified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but keep me from terror.<br>
Bring on them the day of disaster;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy them with double destruction.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Keeping the Sabbath Holy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19377">19</sup> This is
what the LORD said to me: “Go and stand at the gate of the people,
through which the kings of Judah go in and out; stand also at all
the other gates of Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19378">20</sup> Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the
LORD, O kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living
in Jerusalem who come through these gates. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19379">21</sup> This is what the LORD says: Be
careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through
the gates of Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19380">22</sup> Do not bring a load out of your houses
or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I
commanded your forefathers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19381">23</sup> Yet they did not listen or pay
attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond
to discipline. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19382">24</sup>
But if you are careful to obey me, declares the LORD, and bring no
load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the
Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19383">25</sup> then kings who sit on David’s throne
will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They
and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses,
accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and
this city will be inhabited forever. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19384">26</sup> People will come from the towns of
Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of
Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the
Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings,
incense and thank offerings to the house of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19385">27</sup> But if you do not obey me
to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come
through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will
kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will
consume her fortresses.’”
