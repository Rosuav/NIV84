<h4>1 Peter 1</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30360">1</sup> Peter,
an apostle of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God’s elect, strangers in the world,
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and
Bithynia, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30361">2</sup> who
have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus
Christ and sprinkling by his blood:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace and peace be yours in abundance.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Praise to God for a Living Hope</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30362">3</sup> Praise be
to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy
he has given us new birth into a living hope through the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30363">4</sup> and into an inheritance that can
never perish, spoil or fade—kept in heaven for you, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30364">5</sup> who through faith are
shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is
ready to be revealed in the last time. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30365">6</sup> In this you greatly rejoice, though now
for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of
trials. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30366">7</sup> These
have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which
perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may
result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30367">8</sup> Though you have
not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now,
you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and
glorious joy, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30368">9</sup>
for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your
souls.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30369">10</sup>
Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace
that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest
care, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30370">11</sup> trying
to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of
Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of
Christ and the glories that would follow. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30371">12</sup> It was revealed to them that they were
not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that
have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you
by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into
these things.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Be Holy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30372">13</sup>
Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set
your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is
revealed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30373">14</sup> As
obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when
you lived in ignorance. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30374">15</sup> But just as he who called you is holy,
so be holy in all you do; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30375">16</sup> for it is written: “Be holy, because I
am holy.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30375a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30376">17</sup> Since
you call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live
your lives as strangers here in reverent fear. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30377">18</sup> For you know that it was
not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were
redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your
forefathers, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30378">19</sup>
but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or
defect. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30379">20</sup> He was
chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these
last times for your sake. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30380">21</sup> Through him you believe in God, who
raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and
hope are in God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30381">22</sup> Now
that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you
have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from
the heart.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30381b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30382">23</sup> For you have been born again, not of
perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and
enduring word of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30383">24</sup> For,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All men are like grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all their glory is like the flowers of the
field;<br>
the grass withers and the flowers fall,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30384">25</sup> but the
word of the Lord stands forever.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-30384c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the word that was preached to
you.</p>
