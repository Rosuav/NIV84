<h4>Genesis 26</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Isaac and Abimelech</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-694">1</sup> Now there
was a famine in the land—besides the earlier famine of Abraham’s
time—and Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-695">2</sup> The LORD appeared
to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where
I tell you to live. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-696">3</sup> Stay in this land for a while, and I will
be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I
will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your
father Abraham. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-697">4</sup> I
will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and
will give them all these lands, and through your
offspring<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-697a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> all nations on earth will be
blessed, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-698">5</sup> because
Abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees
and my laws.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-699">6</sup> So
Isaac stayed in Gerar.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-700">7</sup> When the
men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my
sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He
thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of
Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-701">8</sup> When
Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines
looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-702">9</sup> So Abimelech
summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say,
‘She is my sister’?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might
lose my life on account of her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-703">10</sup> Then
Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men
might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought
guilt upon us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-704">11</sup> So
Abimelech gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who molests this
man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-705">12</sup> Isaac
planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold,
because the LORD blessed him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-706">13</sup> The man became rich, and his wealth
continued to grow until he became very wealthy. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-707">14</sup> He had so many flocks and
herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-708">15</sup> So all the wells that his
father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the
Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-709">16</sup> Then
Abimelech said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too
powerful for us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-710">17</sup> So
Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and
settled there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-711">18</sup>
Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his
father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham
died, and he gave them the same names his father had given
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-712">19</sup> Isaac’s
servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water
there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-713">20</sup> But the
herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The
water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-713b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> because they disputed with him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-714">21</sup> Then they dug
another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it
Sitnah.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-714c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-715">22</sup> He moved on from there and dug another
well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it
Rehoboth,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-715d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> saying, “Now the LORD has given us
room and we will flourish in the land.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-716">23</sup> From
there he went up to Beersheba. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-717">24</sup> That night the LORD appeared to him and
said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I
am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your
descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-718">25</sup> Isaac
built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he
pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-719">26</sup>
Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his
personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-720">27</sup> Isaac asked
them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and
sent me away?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-721">28</sup> They
answered, “We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said,
‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and
you. Let us make a treaty with you <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-722">29</sup> that you will do us no harm, just as we
did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in
peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-723">30</sup> Isaac
then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-724">31</sup> Early the next morning the
men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way,
and they left him in peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-725">32</sup> That
day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug.
They said, “We’ve found water!” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-726">33</sup> He called it Shibah,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-726e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> and to this day the name of the
town has been Beersheba.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-726f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-727">34</sup> When
Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the
Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-728">35</sup> They were a
source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.</p>
