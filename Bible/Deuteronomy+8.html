<h4>Deuteronomy 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Do Not Forget the LORD</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5139">1</sup> Be careful
to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live
and increase and may enter and possess the land that the LORD
promised on oath to your forefathers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5140">2</sup> Remember how the LORD your God led you
all the way in the desert these forty years, to humble you and to
test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not
you would keep his commands. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5141">3</sup> He humbled you, causing you to hunger and
then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had
known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on
every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5142">4</sup> Your clothes did not wear
out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5143">5</sup> Know then in
your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God
disciplines you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5144">6</sup> Observe
the commands of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and revering
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5145">7</sup> For the
LORD your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with streams
and pools of water, with springs flowing in the valleys and hills;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5146">8</sup> a land with
wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and
honey; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5147">9</sup> a land
where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land
where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the
hills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5148">10</sup> When
you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the
good land he has given you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5149">11</sup> Be careful that you do not forget the
LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his
decrees that I am giving you this day. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5150">12</sup> Otherwise, when you eat and are
satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5151">13</sup> and when your herds and
flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you
have is multiplied, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5152">14</sup> then your heart will become proud and
you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt,
out of the land of slavery. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5153">15</sup> He led you through the vast and dreadful
desert, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes
and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5154">16</sup> He gave you manna to eat
in the desert, something your fathers had never known, to humble
and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5155">17</sup> You may say to
yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this
wealth for me.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5156">18</sup>
But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the
ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he
swore to your forefathers, as it is today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5157">19</sup> If you
ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and
bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely
be destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5158">20</sup>
Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be
destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God.</p>
