<h4>Deuteronomy 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Blessings for Obedience</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5613">1</sup> If you
fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands
I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the
nations on earth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5614">2</sup> All these blessings will come upon you
and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5615">3</sup> You
will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5616">4</sup> The
fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and
the young of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs
of your flocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5617">5</sup> Your
basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5618">6</sup> You
will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5619">7</sup> The
LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be
defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but
flee from you in seven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5620">8</sup> The
LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put
your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is
giving you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5621">9</sup> The
LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on
oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his
ways. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5622">10</sup> Then all
the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of
the LORD, and they will fear you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5623">11</sup> The LORD will grant you abundant
prosperity—in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock
and the crops of your ground—in the land he swore to your
forefathers to give you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5624">12</sup> The
LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send
rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your
hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5625">13</sup> The LORD will
make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the
commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and
carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the
bottom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5626">14</sup> Do not
turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right
or to the left, following other gods and serving them.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Curses for Disobedience</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5627">15</sup> However,
if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow
all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these
curses will come upon you and overtake you:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5628">16</sup> You
will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5629">17</sup> Your
basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5630">18</sup> The
fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and
the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5631">19</sup> You
will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5632">20</sup> The
LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything
you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden
ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-5632a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5633">21</sup> The LORD will plague you with diseases
until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to
possess. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5634">22</sup> The
LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and
inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and
mildew, which will plague you until you perish. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5635">23</sup> The sky over your head
will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5636">24</sup> The LORD will turn the rain of your
country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies
until you are destroyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5637">25</sup> The
LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will
come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and
you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5638">26</sup> Your carcasses
will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the
earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5639">27</sup> The LORD will afflict you
with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the
itch, from which you cannot be cured. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5640">28</sup> The LORD will afflict you with madness,
blindness and confusion of mind. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5641">29</sup> At midday you will grope about like a
blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you
do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to
rescue you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5642">30</sup> You
will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her
and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in
it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy
its fruit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5643">31</sup> Your
ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of
it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be
returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will
rescue them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5644">32</sup>
Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you
will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless
to lift a hand. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5645">33</sup>
A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor
produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your
days. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5646">34</sup> The
sights you see will drive you mad. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5647">35</sup> The LORD will afflict your knees and
legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the
soles of your feet to the top of your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5648">36</sup> The
LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation
unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods,
gods of wood and stone. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5649">37</sup> You will become a thing of horror and an
object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will
drive you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5650">38</sup> You
will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little,
because locusts will devour it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5651">39</sup> You will plant vineyards and cultivate
them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because
worms will eat them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5652">40</sup> You will have olive trees throughout
your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will
drop off. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5653">41</sup> You
will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because
they will go into captivity. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5654">42</sup> Swarms of locusts will take over all
your trees and the crops of your land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5655">43</sup> The
alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher,
but you will sink lower and lower. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5656">44</sup> He will lend to you, but you will not
lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5657">45</sup> All
these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake
you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your
God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5658">46</sup> They will be a sign and a
wonder to you and your descendants forever. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5659">47</sup> Because you did not serve the LORD
your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5660">48</sup> therefore in hunger and
thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies
the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck
until he has destroyed you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5661">49</sup> The
LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends
of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language
you will not understand, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5662">50</sup> a fierce-looking nation without respect
for the old or pity for the young. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5663">51</sup> They will devour the young of your
livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They
will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your
herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5664">52</sup> They will lay siege to all
the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in
which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities
throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5665">53</sup>
Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during
the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the
sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5666">54</sup> Even the most gentle and
sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother
or the wife he loves or his surviving children, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5667">55</sup> and he will not give to
one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It
will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will
inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5668">56</sup> The most gentle and
sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would
not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will
begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5669">57</sup> the afterbirth
from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat
them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy
will inflict on you in your cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5670">58</sup> If you
do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are
written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome
name—the LORD your God— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5671">59</sup> the LORD will send fearful plagues on
you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe
and lingering illnesses. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5672">60</sup> He will bring upon you all the diseases
of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5673">61</sup> The LORD will also bring
on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this
Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5674">62</sup> You who were as numerous as the stars in
the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey
the LORD your God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5675">63</sup> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you
prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and
destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to
possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5676">64</sup> Then
the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the
earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood
and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5677">65</sup> Among those
nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of
your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary
with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5678">66</sup> You will live in constant suspense,
filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5679">67</sup> In the morning
you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening, “If
only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your
hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5680">68</sup> The LORD will send you
back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make
again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as
male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.</p>
