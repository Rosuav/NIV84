<h4>Genesis 32</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-930">1</sup> Jacob also
went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-931">2</sup> When Jacob saw them, he
said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place
Mahanaim.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-931a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-932">3</sup> Jacob
sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of
Seir, the country of Edom. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-933">4</sup> He instructed them: “This is what you are
to say to my master Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been
staying with Laban and have remained there till now. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-934">5</sup> I have cattle and donkeys,
sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending
this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-935">6</sup> When the
messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother
Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are
with him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-936">7</sup> In great
fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into
two groups,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-936b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and the flocks and herds and
camels as well. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-937">8</sup>
He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-937c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> the group<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-937d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> that is left may escape.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-938">9</sup> Then
Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac,
O LORD, who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your
relatives, and I will make you prosper,’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-939">10</sup> I am unworthy of all the kindness and
faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when
I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-940">11</sup> Save me, I pray,
from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and
attack me, and also the mothers with their children. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-941">12</sup> But you have said, ‘I will
surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the
sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-942">13</sup> He
spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a
gift for his brother Esau: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-943">14</sup> two hundred female goats and twenty male
goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-944">15</sup> thirty female camels with their young,
forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male
donkeys. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-945">16</sup> He put
them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to
his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the
herds.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-946">17</sup> He
instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and
asks, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns
all these animals in front of you?’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-947">18</sup> then you are to say, ‘They belong to your
servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is
coming behind us.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-948">19</sup> He also
instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed
the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-949">20</sup> And be sure
to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought,
“I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later,
when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-950">21</sup> So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him,
but he himself spent the night in the camp.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jacob Wrestles With God</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-951">22</sup> That night
Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his
eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-952">23</sup> After he had sent them
across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-953">24</sup> So Jacob was left alone,
and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-954">25</sup> When the man saw that he could not
overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip
was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-955">26</sup> Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is
daybreak.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go
unless you bless me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-956">27</sup> The man
asked him, “What is your name?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Jacob,” he answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-957">28</sup> Then
the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but
Israel,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-957e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> because you have struggled with
God and with men and have overcome.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-958">29</sup> Jacob
said, “Please tell me your name.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then
he blessed him there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-959">30</sup> So
Jacob called the place Peniel,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-959f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> saying,
“It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was
spared.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-960">31</sup> The sun
rose above him as he passed Peniel,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-960g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> and he
was limping because of his hip. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-961">32</sup> Therefore to this day the Israelites do
not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the
socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.</p>
