<h4>Luke 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Sends Out the Twelve</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25295">1</sup> When
Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and
authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25296">2</sup> and he sent them out to
preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25297">3</sup> He told them: <font class=
'woj'>“Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no
money, no extra tunic.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25298">4</sup> Whatever house you enter,
stay there until you leave that town.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25299">5</sup> If people
do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave
their town, as a testimony against them.”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25300">6</sup> So they set out and went
from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people
everywhere.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25301">7</sup> Now
Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was
perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from
the dead, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25302">8</sup>
others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the
prophets of long ago had come back to life. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25303">9</sup> But Herod said, “I beheaded John.
Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see
him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25304">10</sup> When the
apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then
he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town
called Bethsaida, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25305">11</sup> but the crowds learned about it and
followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom
of God, and healed those who needed healing.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25306">12</sup> Late
in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd
away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and
find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25307">13</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“You give them something to
eat.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answered, “We have only five loaves of
bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25308">14</sup> (About five
thousand men were there.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he said to his disciples, <font class=
'woj'>“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25309">15</sup> The disciples
did so, and everybody sat down. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25310">16</sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he
gave them to the disciples to set before the people. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25311">17</sup> They all ate and were
satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken
pieces that were left over.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter’s Confession of Christ</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25312">18</sup> Once
when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him,
he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Who do the crowds say I
am?”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25313">19</sup> They
replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still
others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to
life.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25314">20</sup> “But what about you?”</font> he asked.
<font class='woj'>“Who do you say I am?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter answered, “The Christ<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25314a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of God.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25315">21</sup> Jesus
strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25316">22</sup> And he said, <font class=
'woj'>“The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by
the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be
killed and on the third day be raised to life.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25317">23</sup> Then
he said to them all: <font class='woj'>“If anyone would come after
me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow
me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25318">24</sup> For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25319">25</sup> What good is it for a man to gain the
whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25320">26</sup> If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his
glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25321">27</sup> I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of
God.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Transfiguration</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25322">28</sup> About
eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James
with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25323">29</sup> As he was praying, the appearance of
his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of
lightning. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25324">30</sup> Two
men, Moses and Elijah, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25325">31</sup> appeared in glorious splendor, talking
with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to
bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25326">32</sup> Peter and his companions were very
sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and
the two men standing with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25327">33</sup> As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter
said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up
three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He
did not know what he was saying.)
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25328">34</sup> While
he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were
afraid as they entered the cloud. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25329">35</sup> A voice came from the cloud, saying,
“This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25330">36</sup> When the voice had
spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to
themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Healing of a Boy With an Evil
Spirit</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25331">37</sup> The next
day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25332">38</sup> A man in the
crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is
my only child. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25333">39</sup>
A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into
convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves
him and is destroying him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25334">40</sup> I begged your disciples to drive it
out, but they could not.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25335">41</sup> “O unbelieving and perverse
generation,”</font> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“how long
shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son
here.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25336">42</sup> Even
while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a
convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25336b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> spirit, healed the boy and gave him
back to his father. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25337">43</sup> And they were all amazed at the
greatness of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus
did, he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25338">44</sup> “Listen carefully to what
I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into
the hands of men.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25339">45</sup> But they did not understand what this
meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and
they were afraid to ask him about it.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Who Will Be the Greatest?</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25340">46</sup> An
argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be
the greatest. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25341">47</sup>
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him
stand beside him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25342">48</sup> Then he said to them, <font class=
'woj'>“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me;
and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is
least among you all—he is the greatest.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25343">49</sup>
“Master,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons in your name
and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25344">50</sup> “Do not stop him,”</font> Jesus said,
<font class='woj'>“for whoever is not against you is for
you.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Samaritan Opposition</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25345">51</sup> As the
time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely
set out for Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25346">52</sup> And he sent messengers on ahead, who
went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25347">53</sup> but the people
there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25348">54</sup> When the
disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want
us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25348c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25349">55</sup> But Jesus turned and rebuked them,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25350">56</sup> and<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25350d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> they went to another village.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Cost of Following Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25351">57</sup> As they
were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you
wherever you go.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25352">58</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Foxes have holes and birds of the air
have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his
head.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25353">59</sup> He
said to another man, <font class='woj'>“Follow me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man replied, “Lord, first let me go
and bury my father.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25354">60</sup> Jesus
said to him, <font class='woj'>“Let the dead bury their own dead,
but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25355">61</sup> Still
another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back
and say good-by to my family.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25356">62</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“No one who puts his hand to the plow
and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of
God.”</font></p>
