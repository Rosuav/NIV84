<h4>2 Chronicles 6</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11284">1</sup> Then
Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark
cloud; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11285">2</sup> I have
built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell
forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11286">3</sup> While
the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned
around and blessed them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11287">4</sup> Then he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who
with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my
father David. For he said, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11288">5</sup> ‘Since the day I brought my people out
of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a
temple built for my Name to be there, nor have I chosen anyone to
be the leader over my people Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11289">6</sup> But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my
Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people
Israel.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11290">7</sup> “My
father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of
the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11291">8</sup> But the LORD said to my father David,
‘Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you
did well to have this in your heart. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11292">9</sup> Nevertheless, you are not the one to
build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood—he
is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11293">10</sup> “The
LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father
and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised,
and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of
Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11294">11</sup> There
I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he
made with the people of Israel.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11295">12</sup> Then
Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole
assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11296">13</sup> Now he had made a bronze platform,
five cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11296a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> long, five cubits wide and
three cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11296b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> high, and had placed it in
the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then
knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his
hands toward heaven. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11297">14</sup> He said:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like
you in heaven or on earth—you who keep your covenant of love with
your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11298">15</sup> You have kept your
promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have
promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is
today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11299">16</sup> “Now
LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the
promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to
have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your
sons are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my
law, as you have done.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11300">17</sup> And now, O LORD, God of Israel, let
your word that you promised your servant David come true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11301">18</sup> “But
will God really dwell on earth with men? The heavens, even the
highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I
have built! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11302">19</sup>
Yet give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy,
O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is
praying in your presence. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11303">20</sup> May your eyes be open toward this
temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put
your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward
this place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11304">21</sup>
Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel
when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling
place; and when you hear, forgive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11305">22</sup> “When
a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he
comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11306">23</sup> then hear from
heaven and act. Judge between your servants, repaying the guilty by
bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the
innocent not guilty and so establish his innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11307">24</sup> “When
your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have
sinned against you and when they turn back and confess your name,
praying and making supplication before you in this temple,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11308">25</sup> then hear from
heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them
back to the land you gave to them and their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11309">26</sup> “When
the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people
have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and
confess your name and turn from their sin because you have
afflicted them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11310">27</sup> then hear from heaven and forgive the
sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way
to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an
inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11311">28</sup> “When
famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or
grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities,
whatever disaster or disease may come, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11312">29</sup> and when a prayer or plea is made by
any of your people Israel—each one aware of his afflictions and
pains, and spreading out his hands toward this temple— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11313">30</sup> then hear from heaven,
your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with each man according to
all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the
hearts of men), <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11314">31</sup> so that they will fear you and walk in
your ways all the time they live in the land you gave our
fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11315">32</sup> “As
for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has
come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty
hand and your outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this
temple, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11316">33</sup> then
hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do whatever the
foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may
know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may
know that this house I have built bears your Name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11317">34</sup> “When
your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send
them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen
and the temple I have built for your Name, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-11318">35</sup> then hear from heaven their prayer
and their plea, and uphold their cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11319">36</sup> “When
they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you
become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes
them captive to a land far away or near; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11320">37</sup> and if they have a change of heart in
the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you
in the land of their captivity and say, ‘We have sinned, we have
done wrong and acted wickedly’; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11321">38</sup> and if they turn back to you with all
their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were
taken, and pray toward the land you gave their fathers, toward the
city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your
Name; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11322">39</sup> then
from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their
pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have
sinned against you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11323">40</sup> “Now,
my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the
prayers offered in this place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11324">41</sup> “Now
arise, O LORD God, and come to your resting place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you and the ark of your might.<br>
May your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may your saints rejoice in your goodness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11325">42</sup> O LORD God, do
not reject your anointed one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the great love promised to David your
servant.”</p>
