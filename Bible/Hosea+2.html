<h4>Hosea 2</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22107">1</sup> “Say
of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved
one.’</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel Punished and Restored</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22108">2</sup> “Rebuke
your mother, rebuke her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she is not my wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am not her husband.<br>
Let her remove the adulterous look from her face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the unfaithfulness from between her
breasts.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22109">3</sup> Otherwise I
will strip her naked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make her as bare as on the day she was
born;<br>
I will make her like a desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn her into a parched land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and slay her with thirst.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22110">4</sup> I will not show
my love to her children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they are the children of adultery.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22111">5</sup> Their mother
has been unfaithful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has conceived them in disgrace.<br>
She said, ‘I will go after my lovers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who give me my food and my water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22112">6</sup> Therefore I
will block her path with thornbushes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wall her in so that she cannot find her
way.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22113">7</sup> She will chase
after her lovers but not catch them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will look for them but not find them.<br>
Then she will say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I will go back to my husband as at first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for then I was better off than now.’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22114">8</sup> She has not
acknowledged that I was the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil,<br>
who lavished on her the silver and gold—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which they used for Baal.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22115">9</sup>
“Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my new wine when it is ready.<br>
I will take back my wool and my linen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intended to cover her nakedness.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22116">10</sup> So now I will
expose her lewdness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the eyes of her lovers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will take her out of my hands.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22117">11</sup> I will stop
all her celebrations:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her yearly festivals, her New Moons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her Sabbath days—all her appointed feasts.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22118">12</sup> I will ruin
her vines and her fig trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which she said were her pay from her lovers;<br>
I will make them a thicket,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wild animals will devour them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22119">13</sup> I will punish
her for the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she burned incense to the Baals;<br>
she decked herself with rings and jewelry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went after her lovers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but me she forgot,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22120">14</sup>
“Therefore I am now going to allure her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will lead her into the desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and speak tenderly to her.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22121">15</sup> There I will
give her back her vineyards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will make the Valley of Achor<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22121a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> a door of hope.<br>
There she will sing<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22121b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> as in the
days of her youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in the day she came up out of Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22122">16</sup> “In
that day,” declares the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“you will call me ‘my husband’;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will no longer call me ‘my master.<sup class=

"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>’<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22123">17</sup> I will remove
the names of the Baals from her lips;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no longer will their names be invoked.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22124">18</sup> In that day I
will make a covenant for them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the beasts of the field and the birds of the
air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the creatures that move along the ground.<br>
Bow and sword and battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will abolish from the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that all may lie down in safety.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22125">19</sup> I will betroth
you to me forever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will betroth you in<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22125d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> righteousness and justice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22125e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> love and
compassion.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22126">20</sup> I will betroth
you in faithfulness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will acknowledge the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22127">21</sup> “In
that day I will respond,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD—<br>
“I will respond to the skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will respond to the earth;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22128">22</sup> and the earth
will respond to the grain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new wine and oil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will respond to Jezreel.<sup class=
