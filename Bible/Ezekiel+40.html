<h4>Ezekiel 40</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The New Temple Area</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21479">1</sup> In the
twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on
the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of
the city—on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he
took me there. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21480">2</sup>
In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a
very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that
looked like a city. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21481">3</sup> He took me there, and I saw a man whose
appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a
linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-21482">4</sup> The man said to me, “Son of man, look
with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to
everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been
brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.”
<h5 class="passage-header">The East Gate to the Outer Court</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21483">5</sup> I saw a
wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the
measuring rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each of which
was a cubit<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21483a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and a handbreadth.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21483b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> He measured the wall; it was one
measuring rod thick and one rod high.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21484">6</sup> Then
he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured
the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21484c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21485">7</sup> The alcoves for the guards were one rod
long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves
were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the
portico facing the temple was one rod deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21486">8</sup> Then
he measured the portico of the gateway; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21487">9</sup> it<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21487d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> was eight
cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the
gateway faced the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21488">10</sup>
Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had
the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on
each side had the same measurements. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21489">11</sup> Then he measured the width of the
entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was
thirteen cubits. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21490">12</sup> In front of each alcove was a wall one
cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21491">13</sup> Then he measured the
gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of
the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one
parapet opening to the opposite one. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21492">14</sup> He measured along the faces of the
projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway—sixty cubits.
The measurement was up to the portico<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21492e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> facing the courtyard.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21492f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21493">15</sup> The distance from the entrance of the
gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21494">16</sup> The alcoves and the
projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow
parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all
around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were
decorated with palm trees.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Outer Court</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21495">17</sup> Then he
brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a
pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were
thirty rooms along the pavement. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21496">18</sup> It abutted the sides of the gateways
and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21497">19</sup> Then he
measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the
outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east
side as well as on the north.
<h5 class="passage-header">The North Gate</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21498">20</sup> Then he
measured the length and width of the gate facing north, leading
into the outer court. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21499">21</sup> Its alcoves—three on each side—its
projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those
of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five
cubits wide. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21500">22</sup>
Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the
same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led
up to it, with its portico opposite them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21501">23</sup> There was a gate to the inner court
facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured
from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.
<h5 class="passage-header">The South Gate</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21502">24</sup> Then he
led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured
its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as
the others. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21503">25</sup>
The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like
the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and
twenty-five cubits wide. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21504">26</sup> Seven steps led up to it, with its
portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of
the projecting walls on each side. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21505">27</sup> The inner court also had a gate facing
south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the
south side; it was a hundred cubits.
<h5 class="passage-header">Gates to the Inner Court</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21506">28</sup> Then he
brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he
measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the
others. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21507">29</sup> Its
alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same
measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had
openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five
cubits wide. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21508">30</sup>
(The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were
twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21509">31</sup> Its portico faced the
outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up
to it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21510">32</sup> Then
he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured
the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21511">33</sup> Its alcoves,
its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as
the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It
was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21512">34</sup> Its portico faced the
outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and
eight steps led up to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21513">35</sup> Then
he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same
measurements as the others, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21514">36</sup> as did its alcoves, its projecting
walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty
cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21515">37</sup> Its portico<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21515g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> faced the outer court; palm trees
decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to
it.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21516">38</sup> A room
with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways,
where the burnt offerings were washed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21517">39</sup> In the portico of the gateway were two
tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings
and guilt offerings were slaughtered. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21518">40</sup> By the outside wall of the portico of
the gateway, near the steps at the entrance to the north gateway
were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two
tables. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21519">41</sup> So
there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the
other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21520">42</sup> There were
also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a
cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On
them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings
and the other sacrifices. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-21521">43</sup> And double-pronged hooks, each a
handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables
were for the flesh of the offerings.
<h5 class="passage-header">Rooms for the Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21522">44</sup> Outside
the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms,
one<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21522h" title=
"See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> at the side of the north gate and
facing south, and another at the side of the south<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21522i" title=
"See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> gate and facing north. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21523">45</sup> He said to me, “The room
facing south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21524">46</sup> and the room
facing north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These
are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near
to the LORD to minister before him.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21525">47</sup> Then
he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a
hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Temple</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21526">48</sup> He
brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of
the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width
of the entrance was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls
were<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21526j" title=
"See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> three cubits wide on either side.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21527">49</sup> The portico
was twenty cubits wide, and twelve<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-21527k" title="See footnote k">k</a>]</sup> cubits
from front to back. It was reached by a flight of
stairs,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21527l" title=
"See footnote l">l</a>]</sup> and there were pillars on each side
of the jambs.
