<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3371">1</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3372">2</sup> “Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with
respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to me, so
they will not profane my holy name. I am the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3373">3</sup> “Say to
them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants is
ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that
the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off
from my presence. I am the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3374">4</sup> “‘If a
descendant of Aaron has an infectious skin disease<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3374a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> or a bodily discharge, he may not
eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be
unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone
who has an emission of semen, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3375">5</sup> or if he touches any crawling thing that
makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever
the uncleanness may be. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3376">6</sup> The one who touches any such thing will
be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred
offerings unless he has bathed himself with water. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3377">7</sup> When the sun goes down, he
will be clean, and after that he may eat the sacred offerings, for
they are his food. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3378">8</sup> He must not eat anything found dead or
torn by wild animals, and so become unclean through it. I am the
LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3379">9</sup> “‘The
priests are to keep my requirements so that they do not become
guilty and die for treating them with contempt. I am the LORD, who
makes them holy.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3379b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3380">10</sup> “‘No
one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may
the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3381">11</sup> But if a priest buys a
slave with money, or if a slave is born in his household, that
slave may eat his food. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3382">12</sup> If a priest’s daughter marries anyone
other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred
contributions. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3383">13</sup>
But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has
no children, and she returns to live in her father’s house as in
her youth, she may eat of her father’s food. No unauthorized
person, however, may eat any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3384">14</sup> “‘If
anyone eats a sacred offering by mistake, he must make restitution
to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3385">15</sup> The priests
must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to
the LORD <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3386">16</sup> by
allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them
guilt requiring payment. I am the LORD, who makes them holy.’”</p>

said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3388">18</sup>
“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to
them: ‘If any of you—either an Israelite or an alien living in
Israel—presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, either to
fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3389">19</sup> you must present a male without defect
from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on
your behalf. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3390">20</sup> Do
not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted
on your behalf. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3391">21</sup>
When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship
offering<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3391c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> to the LORD to fulfill a special
vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without defect or blemish
to be acceptable. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3392">22</sup> Do not offer to the LORD the blind, the
injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or
running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as an
offering made to the LORD by fire. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3393">23</sup> You may, however, present as a freewill
offering an ox<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3393d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> or a sheep that is deformed
or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3394">24</sup> You must not
offer to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed,
torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3395">25</sup> and you must not accept
such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the
food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because
they are deformed and have defects.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3396">26</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3397">27</sup> “When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born,
it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day
on, it will be acceptable as an offering made to the LORD by fire.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3398">28</sup> Do not
slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3399">29</sup> “When
you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, sacrifice it in such a
way that it will be accepted on your behalf. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3400">30</sup> It must be eaten that same day; leave
none of it till morning. I am the LORD.</p>

my commands and follow them. I am the LORD. <sup class="versenum"
