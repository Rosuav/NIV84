<h4>Jeremiah 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The False Prophet Hananiah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19620">1</sup> In the
fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign
of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who
was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the
presence of the priests and all the people: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19621">2</sup> “This is what the LORD Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19622">3</sup> Within two
years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the
LORD’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here
and took to Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19623">4</sup> I will also bring back to this place
Jehoiachin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19623a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah
and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares
the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19624">5</sup> Then
the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the
priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19625">6</sup> He said,
“Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have
prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD’s house and all the
exiles back to this place from Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19626">7</sup> Nevertheless, listen to what I have to
say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19627">8</sup> From early
times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war,
disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19628">9</sup> But the prophet
who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the
LORD only if his prediction comes true.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19629">10</sup> Then
the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet
Jeremiah and broke it, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19630">11</sup> and he said before all the people,
“This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way will I break the yoke
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations
within two years.’” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his
way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19631">12</sup>
Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck
of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19632">13</sup> “Go and tell
Hananiah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden
yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19633">14</sup> This is what the LORD
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the
necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control
over the wild animals.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19634">15</sup> Then
the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen,
Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this
nation to trust in lies. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19635">16</sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very
year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion
against the LORD.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19636">17</sup> In
the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.</p>
