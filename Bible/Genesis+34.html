<h4>Genesis 34</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Dinah and the Shechemites</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-982">1</sup> Now Dinah,
the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women
of the land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-983">2</sup> When
Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her,
he took her and violated her. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-984">3</sup> His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of
Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-985">4</sup> And Shechem said to his
father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-986">5</sup> When
Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were
in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about it until
they came home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-987">6</sup> Then
Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-988">7</sup> Now Jacob’s sons had come in
from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were
filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a disgraceful
thing in<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-988a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> Israel by lying with Jacob’s
daughter—a thing that should not be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-989">8</sup> But
Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your
daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-990">9</sup> Intermarry with us; give us your
daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-991">10</sup> You can settle among us;
the land is open to you. Live in it, trade<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-991b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> in it, and acquire property in
it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-992">11</sup> Then
Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in
your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-993">12</sup> Make the price for the
bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay
whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-994">13</sup> Because
their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied
deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-995">14</sup> They said to
them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man
who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-996">15</sup> We will give our consent to
you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising
all your males. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-997">16</sup>
Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for
ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-998">17</sup> But if you will
not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-998c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> and go.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-999">18</sup> Their
proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1000">19</sup> The young man, who was the
most honored of all his father’s household, lost no time in doing
what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1001">20</sup> So Hamor and
his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their
fellow townsmen. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1002">21</sup> “These men are friendly toward us,” they
said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has
plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can
marry ours. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1003">22</sup> But
the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the
condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1004">23</sup> Won’t their
livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours?
So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among
us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1005">24</sup> All
the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son
Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1006">25</sup> Three
days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s
sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and
attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1007">26</sup> They put Hamor and his son
Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1008">27</sup> The sons of
Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city
where<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1008d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> their sister had been defiled.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1009">28</sup> They seized
their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in
the city and out in the fields. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1010">29</sup> They carried off all their wealth and
all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the
houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1011">30</sup> Then
Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by
making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people
living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces
against me and attack me, I and my household will be
destroyed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1012">31</sup> But
they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a
prostitute?”</p>
