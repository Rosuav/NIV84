<h4>1 Corinthians 6</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Lawsuits Among Believers</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28453">1</sup> If any of
you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly
for judgment instead of before the saints? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28454">2</sup> Do you not know that the saints will
judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not
competent to judge trivial cases? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28455">3</sup> Do you not know that we will judge
angels? How much more the things of this life! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28456">4</sup> Therefore, if you have
disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little
account in the church!<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28456a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28457">5</sup> I say this to
shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise
enough to judge a dispute between believers? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28458">6</sup> But instead, one brother goes to law
against another—and this in front of unbelievers!
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28459">7</sup> The
very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been
completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not
rather be cheated? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28460">8</sup> Instead, you yourselves cheat and do
wrong, and you do this to your brothers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28461">9</sup> Do you
not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do
not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor
adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28462">10</sup> nor thieves
nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will
inherit the kingdom of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28463">11</sup> And that is what some of you were. But
you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Sexual Immorality</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28464">12</sup>
“Everything is permissible for me”—but not everything is
beneficial. “Everything is permissible for me”—but I will not be
mastered by anything. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28465">13</sup> “Food for the stomach and the stomach
for food”—but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for
sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28466">14</sup> By his power
God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28467">15</sup> Do you not
know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then
take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28468">16</sup> Do you not
know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her
in body? For it is said, “The two will become one
flesh.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28468b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28469">17</sup> But he who unites himself with the Lord
is one with him in spirit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28470">18</sup> Flee
from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside
his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28471">19</sup> Do you not
know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you,
whom you have received from God? You are not your own; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28472">20</sup> you were bought at a
price. Therefore honor God with your body.</p>
