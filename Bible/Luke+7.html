<h4>Luke 7</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Faith of the Centurion</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25189">1</sup> When
Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he
entered Capernaum. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25190">2</sup> There a centurion’s servant, whom his
master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25191">3</sup> The centurion heard of
Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come
and heal his servant. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25192">4</sup> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded
earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25193">5</sup> because he
loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25194">6</sup> So Jesus went with them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not far from the house when the
centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble
yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25195">7</sup> That is why I
did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the
word, and my servant will be healed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25196">8</sup> For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and
that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and
he does it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25197">9</sup> When
Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd
following him, he said, <font class='woj'>“I tell you, I have not
found such great faith even in Israel.”</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25198">10</sup> Then the men who had been
sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25199">11</sup> Soon
afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and
a large crowd went along with him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25200">12</sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead
person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she
was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25201">13</sup> When the Lord
saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, <font class=
'woj'>“Don’t cry.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25202">14</sup> Then
he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood
still. He said, <font class='woj'>“Young man, I say to you, get
up!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25203">15</sup>
The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to
his mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25204">16</sup> They
were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has
appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25205">17</sup> This news
about Jesus spread throughout Judea<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25205a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and the
surrounding country.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus and John the Baptist</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25206">18</sup> John’s
disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25207">19</sup> he sent them
to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who was to come, or should we
expect someone else?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25208">20</sup> When
the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you
to ask, ‘Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect
someone else?’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25209">21</sup> At
that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and
evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25210">22</sup> So he replied to the
messengers, <font class='woj'>“Go back and report to John what you
have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those
who have leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25210b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> are
cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is
preached to the poor.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25211">23</sup> Blessed is the man who
does not fall away on account of me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25212">24</sup> After
John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about
John: <font class='woj'>“What did you go out into the desert to
see? A reed swayed by the wind?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25213">25</sup> If not,
what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No,
those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in
palaces.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25214">26</sup> But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25215">27</sup> This is the one about whom it is
written:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘I will send my messenger
ahead of you,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>who will prepare your way
before you.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25215c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25216">28</sup> I tell you, among those born of women
there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the
kingdom of God is greater than he.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25217">29</sup> (All
the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words,
acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been
baptized by John. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25218">30</sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the
law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not
been baptized by John.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25219">31</sup> “To what, then, can I compare the
people of this generation? What are they like?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25220">32</sup> They are
like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each
other:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘We played the flute for
you,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and you did not
dance;</font><br>
<font class='woj'>we sang a dirge,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and you did not
cry.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25221">33</sup> For John the Baptist came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a
demon.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25222">34</sup> The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend
of tax collectors and “sinners.”’</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25223">35</sup> But
wisdom is proved right by all her children.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25224">36</sup> Now one
of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went
to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25225">37</sup> When a woman who had
lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at
the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25226">38</sup> and as she
stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet
with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and
poured perfume on them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25227">39</sup> When
the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If
this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what
kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25228">40</sup> Jesus
answered him, <font class='woj'>“Simon, I have something to tell
you.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tell me, teacher,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25229">41</sup> “Two men owed money to a certain
moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25229d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> and the other fifty.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25230">42</sup> Neither of them had the money to pay
him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will
love him more?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25231">43</sup> Simon
replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“You have judged
correctly,”</font> Jesus said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25232">44</sup> Then
he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, <font class='woj'>“Do
you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any
water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped
them with her hair.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25233">45</sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this
woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my
feet.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25234">46</sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she
has poured perfume on my feet.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25235">47</sup> Therefore, I tell you,
her many sins have been forgiven—for she loved much. But he who has
been forgiven little loves little.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25236">48</sup> Then
Jesus said to her, <font class='woj'>“Your sins are
forgiven.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25237">49</sup> The
other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even
forgives sins?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25238">50</sup> Jesus
said to the woman, <font class='woj'>“Your faith has saved you; go
in peace.”</font></p>
