<h4>1 Samuel 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Samuel Anoints David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7597">1</sup> The LORD
said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have
rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on
your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one
of his sons to be king.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7598">2</sup> But
Samuel said, “How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill
me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and
say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-7599">3</sup> Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I
will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I
indicate.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7600">4</sup> Samuel
did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of
the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in
peace?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7601">5</sup> Samuel
replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.
Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he
consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the
sacrifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7602">6</sup> When
they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD’s
anointed stands here before the LORD.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7603">7</sup> But the
LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height,
for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man
looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks
at the heart.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7604">8</sup> Then
Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But
Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7605">9</sup> Jesse then had Shammah pass
by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the LORD chosen this one.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7606">10</sup> Jesse had seven
of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The LORD
has not chosen these.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7607">11</sup> So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the
sons you have?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered,
“but he is tending the sheep.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit
down<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7607a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> until he arrives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7608">12</sup> So he
sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance
and handsome features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; he
is the one.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7609">13</sup> So
Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his
brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon
David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">David in Saul’s Service</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7610">14</sup> Now the
Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7610b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> spirit from the LORD tormented
him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7611">15</sup> Saul’s
attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7612">16</sup> Let our
lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play
the harp. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes upon
you, and you will feel better.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7613">17</sup> So
Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring
him to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7614">18</sup> One of
the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who
knows how to play the harp. He is a brave man and a warrior. He
speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the LORD is with
him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7615">19</sup> Then
Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David,
who is with the sheep.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7616">20</sup> So Jesse took a donkey loaded with
bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son
David to Saul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7617">21</sup> David
came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and
David became one of his armor-bearers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7618">22</sup> Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying,
“Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with
him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7619">23</sup>
Whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take his
harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel
better, and the evil spirit would leave him.</p>
