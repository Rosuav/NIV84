<h5 class="passage-header">Gifts of Prophecy and Tongues</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28664">1</sup> Follow
the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the
gift of prophecy. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28665">2</sup> For anyone who speaks in a
tongue<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28665a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> does not speak to men but to God.
Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his
spirit.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28665b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28666">3</sup> But everyone who prophesies speaks to
men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28667">4</sup> He who speaks in a tongue
edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28668">5</sup> I would like
every one of you to speak in tongues,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28668c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> but I would rather have you
prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in
tongues,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28668d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> unless he interprets, so that the
church may be edified.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28669">6</sup> Now,
brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I
be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or
prophecy or word of instruction? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28670">7</sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that
make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what
tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28671">8</sup> Again, if the
trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28672">9</sup> So it is with
you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will
anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the
air. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28673">10</sup>
Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none
of them is without meaning. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28674">11</sup> If then I do not grasp the meaning of
what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is
a foreigner to me. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28675">12</sup> So it is with you. Since you are eager
to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the
church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28676">13</sup> For
this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may
interpret what he says. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28677">14</sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28678">15</sup> So what shall I do? I will pray with my
spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my
spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28679">16</sup> If you are praising God with your
spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not
understand<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28679e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> say “Amen” to your
thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28680">17</sup> You may be
giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28681">18</sup> I
thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28682">19</sup> But in the church I would
rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten
thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28683">20</sup>
Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be
infants, but in your thinking be adults. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28684">21</sup> In the Law it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Through men of strange tongues<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and through the lips of foreigners<br>
I will speak to this people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but even then they will not listen to
me,”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28684f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says
the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28685">22</sup>
Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers;
prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28686">23</sup> So if the
whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and
some who do not understand<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28686g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> or
some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of
your mind? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28687">24</sup> But
if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28687h" title=
"Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> comes in while everybody is
prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and
will be judged by all, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28688">25</sup> and the secrets of his heart will be
laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God
is really among you!”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Orderly Worship</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28689">26</sup> What
then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a
hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an
interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of
the church. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28690">27</sup> If
anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak,
one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28691">28</sup> If there is no interpreter, the
speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and
God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28692">29</sup> Two
or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh
carefully what is said. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28693">30</sup> And if a revelation comes to someone
who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28694">31</sup> For you can all prophesy
in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28695">32</sup> The spirits of
prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28696">33</sup> For God is not a God of
disorder but of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all the congregations of the saints,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28697">34</sup> women should
remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but
must be in submission, as the Law says. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28698">35</sup> If they want to inquire about
something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is
disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28699">36</sup> Did
the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it
has reached? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28700">37</sup>
If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him
acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28701">38</sup> If he ignores
this, he himself will be ignored.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-28701i" title="Vea nota al pie i">i</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28702">39</sup>
Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid
speaking in tongues. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28703">40</sup> But everything should be done in a
fitting and orderly way.</p>
