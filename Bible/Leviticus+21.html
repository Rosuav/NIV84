<h5 class="passage-header">Rules for Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3347">1</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to
them: ‘A priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean for any
of his people who die, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3348">2</sup> except for a close relative, such as his
mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3349">3</sup> or an unmarried sister who
is dependent on him since she has no husband—for her he may make
himself unclean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3350">4</sup>
He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by
marriage,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3350a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and so defile himself.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3351">5</sup>
“‘Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of
their beards or cut their bodies. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3352">6</sup> They must be holy to their God and must
not profane the name of their God. Because they present the
offerings made to the LORD by fire, the food of their God, they are
to be holy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3353">7</sup> “‘They
must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their
husbands, because priests are holy to their God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3354">8</sup> Regard them as holy,
because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy,
because I the LORD am holy—I who make you holy.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3354b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3355">9</sup> “‘If a
priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she
disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3356">10</sup> “‘The
high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing
oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the
priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3356c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> or tear his clothes. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3357">11</sup> He must not enter a place
where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even
for his father or mother, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3358">12</sup> nor leave the sanctuary of his God or
desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of
his God. I am the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3359">13</sup> “‘The
woman he marries must be a virgin. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3360">14</sup> He must not marry a widow, a divorced
woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from
his own people, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3361">15</sup>
so he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the
LORD, who makes him holy.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3361d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3362">16</sup> The
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3363">17</sup> “Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to
come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to
offer the food of his God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3364">18</sup> No man who has any defect may come near:
no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3365">19</sup> no man with a crippled
foot or hand, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3366">20</sup>
or who is hunchbacked or dwarfed, or who has any eye defect, or who
has festering or running sores or damaged testicles. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3367">21</sup> No descendant of Aaron the
priest who has any defect is to come near to present the offerings
made to the LORD by fire. He has a defect; he must not come near to
offer the food of his God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3368">22</sup> He may eat the most holy food of his
God, as well as the holy food; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3369">23</sup> yet because of his defect, he must not
go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my
sanctuary. I am the LORD, who makes them holy.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3369e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup>’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3370">24</sup> So
Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the
Israelites.</p>
