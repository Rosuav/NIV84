<h5 class="passage-header">Ezekiel’s Call</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20494">1</sup> He said
to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20495">2</sup> As he spoke,
the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him
speaking to me.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20496">3</sup> He
said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a
rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their
fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20497">4</sup> The people to
whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them,
‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20498">5</sup> And whether they listen or fail to
listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a
prophet has been among them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20499">6</sup> And you, son of man, do not be afraid of
them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are
all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of
what they say or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious
house. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20500">7</sup> You must
speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for
they are rebellious. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20501">8</sup> But you, son of man, listen to what I
say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your
mouth and eat what I give you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20502">9</sup> Then I
looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20503">10</sup> which he
unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of
lament and mourning and woe.</p>
