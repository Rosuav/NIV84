<h4>Hosea 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The LORD’s Anger Against Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22268">1</sup> When
Ephraim spoke, men trembled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was exalted in Israel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he became guilty of Baal worship and
died.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22269">2</sup> Now they sin
more and more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make idols for themselves from their
silver,<br>
cleverly fashioned images,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of them the work of craftsmen.<br>
It is said of these people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They offer human sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kiss<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22269a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the
calf-idols.”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22270">3</sup> Therefore they
will be like the morning mist,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the early dew that disappears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like chaff swirling from a threshing floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like smoke escaping through a window.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22271">4</sup> “But I
am the LORD your God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who brought you out of<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22271b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Egypt.<br>
You shall acknowledge no God but me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no Savior except me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22272">5</sup> I cared for you
in the desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of burning heat.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22273">6</sup> When I fed
them, they were satisfied;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they were satisfied, they became proud;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then they forgot me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22274">7</sup> So I will come
upon them like a lion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a leopard I will lurk by the path.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22275">8</sup> Like a bear
robbed of her cubs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will attack them and rip them open.<br>
Like a lion I will devour them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wild animal will tear them apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22276">9</sup> “You
are destroyed, O Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you are against me, against your
helper.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22277">10</sup> Where is your
king, that he may save you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are your rulers in all your towns,<br>
of whom you said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Give me a king and princes’?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22278">11</sup> So in my anger
I gave you a king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in my wrath I took him away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22279">12</sup> The guilt of
Ephraim is stored up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sins are kept on record.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22280">13</sup> Pains as of a
woman in childbirth come to him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he is a child without wisdom;<br>
when the time arrives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not come to the opening of the womb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22281">14</sup> “I
will ransom them from the power of the grave<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22281c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will redeem them from death.<br>
Where, O death, are your plagues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, O grave,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22281d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> is your
destruction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will have no compassion,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22282">15</sup> even
though he thrives among his brothers.<br>
An east wind from the LORD will come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blowing in from the desert;<br>
his spring will fail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his well dry up.<br>
His storehouse will be plundered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all its treasures.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22283">16</sup> The people of
Samaria must bear their guilt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have rebelled against their God.<br>
They will fall by the sword;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their little ones will be dashed to the
ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their pregnant women ripped open.”</p>
