<h4>2 Corinthians 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Our Heavenly Dwelling</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28863">1</sup> Now we
know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a
building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human
hands. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28864">2</sup>
Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly
dwelling, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28865">3</sup>
because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28866">4</sup> For while we
are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish
to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so
that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28867">5</sup> Now it is God who has made
us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit,
guaranteeing what is to come.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28868">6</sup>
Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are
at home in the body we are away from the Lord. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28869">7</sup> We live by faith, not by
sight. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28870">8</sup> We are
confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at
home with the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28871">9</sup> So we make it our goal to please him,
whether we are at home in the body or away from it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28872">10</sup> For we must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what
is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or
bad.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Ministry of Reconciliation</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28873">11</sup> Since,
then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men.
What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your
conscience. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28874">12</sup> We
are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving
you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer
those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the
heart. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28875">13</sup> If we
are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our
right mind, it is for you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28876">14</sup> For Christ’s love compels us, because
we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28877">15</sup> And he died
for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves
but for him who died for them and was raised again.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28878">16</sup> So
from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though
we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28879">17</sup> Therefore, if
anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the
new has come! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28880">18</sup>
All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ
and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28881">19</sup> that God was reconciling the world
to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them. And he
has committed to us the message of reconciliation. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28882">20</sup> We are therefore Christ’s
ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We
implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28883">21</sup> God made him who had no
sin to be sin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28883a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> for us, so that in him we
might become the righteousness of God.</p>
