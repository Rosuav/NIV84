<h4>2 Samuel 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Amnon and Tamar</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8319">1</sup> In the
course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the
beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8320">2</sup> Amnon
became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister
Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do
anything to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8321">3</sup> Now
Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother.
Jonadab was a very shrewd man. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8322">4</sup> He asked Amnon, “Why do you, the king’s
son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my
brother Absalom’s sister.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8323">5</sup> “Go to
bed and pretend to be ill,” Jonadab said. “When your father comes
to see you, say to him, ‘I would like my sister Tamar to come and
give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I
may watch her and then eat it from her hand.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8324">6</sup> So
Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see
him, Amnon said to him, “I would like my sister Tamar to come and
make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her
hand.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8325">7</sup> David
sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Go to the house of your brother
Amnon and prepare some food for him.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8326">8</sup> So Tamar went to the house of her brother
Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made
the bread in his sight and baked it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8327">9</sup> Then she took the pan and served him the
bread, but he refused to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Send everyone out of here,” Amnon said. So
everyone left him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8328">10</sup> Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the
food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar
took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon
in his bedroom. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8329">11</sup>
But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come
to bed with me, my sister.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8330">12</sup>
“Don’t, my brother!” she said to him. “Don’t force me. Such a thing
should not be done in Israel! Don’t do this wicked thing.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8331">13</sup> What about me?
Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would
be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the
king; he will not keep me from being married to you.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8332">14</sup> But he refused to listen
to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8333">15</sup> Then
Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more
than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8334">16</sup> “No!”
she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than
what you have already done to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he refused to listen to her. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8335">17</sup> He called his personal
servant and said, “Get this woman out of here and bolt the door
after her.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8336">18</sup> So
his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was
wearing a richly ornamented<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-8336a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> robe,
for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king
wore. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8337">19</sup> Tamar put
ashes on her head and tore the ornamented<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8337b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> robe she was wearing. She put her
hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8338">20</sup> Her
brother Absalom said to her, “Has that Amnon, your brother, been
with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don’t take
this thing to heart.” And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s
house, a desolate woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8339">21</sup> When
King David heard all this, he was furious. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8340">22</sup> Absalom never said a word to Amnon,
either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his
sister Tamar.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Absalom Kills Amnon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8341">23</sup> Two years
later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the
border of Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons to come there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8342">24</sup> Absalom went to
the king and said, “Your servant has had shearers come. Will the
king and his officials please join me?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8343">25</sup> “No,
my son,” the king replied. “All of us should not go; we would only
be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he still refused
to go, but gave him his blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8344">26</sup> Then
Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon come with
us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king asked him, “Why should he go with
you?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8345">27</sup> But
Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the
king’s sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8346">28</sup>
Absalom ordered his men, “Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits
from drinking wine and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ then kill
him. Don’t be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong
and brave.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8347">29</sup> So
Absalom’s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the
king’s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8348">30</sup> While
they were on their way, the report came to David: “Absalom has
struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8349">31</sup> The king stood
up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his
servants stood by with their clothes torn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8350">32</sup> But
Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “My lord should not
think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This
has been Absalom’s expressed intention ever since the day Amnon
raped his sister Tamar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8351">33</sup> My lord the king should not be concerned
about the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is
dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8352">34</sup>
Meanwhile, Absalom had fled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the man standing watch looked up and saw
many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the
hill. The watchman went and told the king, “I see men in the
direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8352c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8353">35</sup>
Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons are here; it has
happened just as your servant said.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8354">36</sup> As he
finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. The
king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8355">37</sup>
Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.
But King David mourned for his son every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8356">38</sup> After
Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8357">39</sup> And the spirit
of the king<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8357d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> longed to go to Absalom, for
he was consoled concerning Amnon’s death.</p>
