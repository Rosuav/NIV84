<h4>2 Chronicles 17</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoshaphat King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11525">1</sup>
Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself
against Israel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11526">2</sup>
He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put
garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa
had captured.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11527">3</sup> The
LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in
the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the
Baals <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11528">4</sup> but
sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than
the practices of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11529">5</sup> The LORD established the kingdom under
his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he
had great wealth and honor. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11530">6</sup> His heart was devoted to the ways of the
LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles
from Judah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11531">7</sup> In the
third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah,
Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11532">8</sup> With them were
certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth,
Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah—and the priests
Elishama and Jehoram. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11533">9</sup> They taught throughout Judah, taking
with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all
the towns of Judah and taught the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11534">10</sup> The
fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding
Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11535">11</sup> Some Philistines brought
Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him
flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven
hundred goats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11536">12</sup>
Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store
cities in Judah <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11537">13</sup> and had large supplies in the towns of
Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11538">14</sup> Their
enrollment by families was as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting
men;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11539">15</sup> next,
Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11540">16</sup> next,
Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of
the LORD, with 200,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11541">17</sup> From
Benjamin:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men
armed with bows and shields;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11542">18</sup> next,
Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11543">19</sup> These
were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the
fortified cities throughout Judah.</p>
