<h4>Exodus 22</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Protection of Property</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2115">1</sup> “If a man
steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he must pay
back five head of cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2116">2</sup> “If a
thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the
defender is not guilty of bloodshed; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2117">3</sup> but if it happens<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2117a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> after sunrise, he is guilty of
bloodshed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A thief must certainly make restitution, but
if he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for his theft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2118">4</sup> “If the
stolen animal is found alive in his possession—whether ox or donkey
or sheep—he must pay back double.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2119">5</sup> “If a
man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray
and they graze in another man’s field, he must make restitution
from the best of his own field or vineyard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2120">6</sup> “If a
fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns
shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who
started the fire must make restitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2121">7</sup> “If a
man gives his neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are
stolen from the neighbor’s house, the thief, if he is caught, must
pay back double. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2122">8</sup>
But if the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear
before the judges<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2122b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> to
determine whether he has laid his hands on the other man’s
property. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2123">9</sup> In all
cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment,
or any other lost property about which somebody says, ‘This is
mine,’ both parties are to bring their cases before the judges. The
one whom the judges declare<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2123c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> guilty
must pay back double to his neighbor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2124">10</sup> “If a
man gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep or any other animal to his
neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or is injured or is taken away
while no one is looking, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2125">11</sup> the issue between them will be settled
by the taking of an oath before the LORD that the neighbor did not
lay hands on the other person’s property. The owner is to accept
this, and no restitution is required. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2126">12</sup> But if the animal was stolen from the
neighbor, he must make restitution to the owner. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2127">13</sup> If it was torn to pieces
by a wild animal, he shall bring in the remains as evidence and he
will not be required to pay for the torn animal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2128">14</sup> “If a
man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies
while the owner is not present, he must make restitution.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2129">15</sup> But if the
owner is with the animal, the borrower will not have to pay. If the
animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Social Responsibility</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2130">16</sup> “If a man
seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with
her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2131">17</sup> If her father
absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the
bride-price for virgins.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2132">18</sup> “Do
not allow a sorceress to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2133">19</sup>
“Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to
death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2134">20</sup>
“Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the LORD must be
destroyed.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2134d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2135">21</sup> “Do
not mistreat an alien or oppress him, for you were aliens in
Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2136">22</sup> “Do
not take advantage of a widow or an orphan. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2137">23</sup> If you do and they cry out to me, I
will certainly hear their cry. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2138">24</sup> My anger will be aroused, and I will
kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your
children fatherless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2139">25</sup> “If
you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not
be like a moneylender; charge him no interest.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2139e" title=
"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2140">26</sup> If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a
pledge, return it to him by sunset, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2141">27</sup> because his cloak is the only covering
he has for his body. What else will he sleep in? When he cries out
to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2142">28</sup> “Do
not blaspheme God<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2142f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> or
curse the ruler of your people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2143">29</sup> “Do
not hold back offerings from your granaries or your
vats.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2143g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2144">30</sup> Do the same
with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers
for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2145">31</sup> “You
are to be my holy people. So do not eat the meat of an animal torn
by wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.</p>
