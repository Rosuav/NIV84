<h5 class="passage-header">Hezekiah’s Illness</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10100">1</sup> In those
days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet
Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the LORD
says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you
will not recover.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10101">2</sup>
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10102">3</sup> “Remember, O
LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted
devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah
wept bitterly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10103">4</sup> Before
Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10104">5</sup> “Go back and
tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, ‘This is what the LORD, the
God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen
your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go
up to the temple of the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10105">6</sup> I will add fifteen years to your life.
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of
Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my
servant David.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10106">7</sup> Then
Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” They did so and applied
it to the boil, and he recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10107">8</sup>
Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the LORD
will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the
third day from now?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10108">9</sup> Isaiah
answered, “This is the LORD’s sign to you that the LORD will do
what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or
shall it go back ten steps?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10109">10</sup> “It
is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps,” said
Hezekiah. “Rather, have it go back ten steps.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10110">11</sup> Then
the prophet Isaiah called upon the LORD, and the LORD made the
shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of
Ahaz.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Envoys From Babylon</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10111">12</sup> At that
time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah
letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah’s illness.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10112">13</sup> Hezekiah
received the messengers and showed them all that was in his
storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine oil—his
armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing
in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show
them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10113">14</sup> Then
Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those
men say, and where did they come from?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They
came from Babylon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10114">15</sup> The
prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah
said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show
them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10115">16</sup> Then
Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10116">17</sup> The time will surely come
when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have
stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing
will be left, says the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10117">18</sup> And some of your descendants, your own
flesh and blood, that will be born to you, will be taken away, and
they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10118">19</sup> “The
word of the LORD you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he
thought, “Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10119">20</sup> As
for the other events of Hezekiah’s reign, all his achievements and
how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into
the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Judah? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10120">21</sup> Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And
Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</p>
