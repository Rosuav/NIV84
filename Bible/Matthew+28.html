<h4>Matthew 28</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Resurrection</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24194">1</sup> After the
Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and
the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24195">2</sup> There
was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from
heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24196">3</sup> His appearance
was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24197">4</sup> The guards were so afraid
of him that they shook and became like dead men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24198">5</sup> The
angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are
looking for Jesus, who was crucified. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24199">6</sup> He is not here; he has risen, just as he
said. Come and see the place where he lay. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-24200">7</sup> Then go quickly and tell his
disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you
into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24201">8</sup> So the
women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and
ran to tell his disciples. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24202">9</sup> Suddenly Jesus met them. <font class=
'woj'>“Greetings,”</font> he said. They came to him, clasped his
feet and worshiped him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24203">10</sup> Then Jesus said to them, <font class=
'woj'>“Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee;
there they will see me.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Guards’ Report</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24204">11</sup> While
the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city
and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24205">12</sup> When the chief
priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the
soldiers a large sum of money, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24206">13</sup> telling them, “You are to say, ‘His
disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were
asleep.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24207">14</sup> If
this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you
out of trouble.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24208">15</sup> So the soldiers took the money and did
as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated
among the Jews to this very day.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Great Commission</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-24209">16</sup> Then the
eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had
told them to go. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24210">17</sup> When they saw him, they worshiped him;
but some doubted. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24211">18</sup> Then Jesus came to them and said,
<font class='woj'>“All authority in heaven and on earth has been
given to me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24212">19</sup> Therefore go and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-24212a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-24213">20</sup> and teaching them to obey everything I
have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very
end of the age.”</font>
