<h4>Luke 4</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Temptation of Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25057">1</sup> Jesus,
full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by
the Spirit in the desert, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25058">2</sup> where for forty days he was tempted by
the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them
he was hungry.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25059">3</sup> The
devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to
become bread.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25060">4</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“It is written: ‘Man does not live on
bread alone.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25060a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25061">5</sup> The
devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all
the kingdoms of the world. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25062">6</sup> And he said to him, “I will give you all
their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me, and I
can give it to anyone I want to. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25063">7</sup> So if you worship me, it will all be
yours.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25064">8</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your
God and serve him only.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25064b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25065">9</sup> The
devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point
of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw
yourself down from here. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25066">10</sup> For it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘He will command his angels concerning
you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to guard you carefully;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25067">11</sup> they will lift
you up in their hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that you will not strike your foot against a
stone.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25067c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25068">12</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“It says: ‘Do not put the Lord your God
to the test.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25068d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25069">13</sup> When
the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an
opportune time.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25070">14</sup> Jesus
returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him
spread through the whole countryside. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25071">15</sup> He taught in their synagogues, and
everyone praised him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25072">16</sup> He
went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath
day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up
to read. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25073">17</sup> The
scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he
found the place where it is written:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25074">18</sup> “The Spirit of the Lord is on
me,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>because he has anointed
me</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>to preach good news to the
poor.</font><br>
<font class='woj'>He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the
prisoners</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and recovery of sight for the
blind,</font><br>
<font class='woj'>to release the oppressed,</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25075">19</sup> to proclaim the year of the Lord’s
favor.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25075e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25076">20</sup> Then
he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25077">21</sup> and he began
by saying to them, <font class='woj'>“Today this scripture is
fulfilled in your hearing.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25078">22</sup> All
spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came
from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25079">23</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“Surely you will quote this proverb
to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we
have heard that you did in Capernaum.’”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25080">24</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> he
continued, <font class='woj'>“no prophet is accepted in his
hometown.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25081">25</sup> I assure you that there were many
widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three
and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the
land.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25082">26</sup> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them,
but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25083">27</sup> And there were many in Israel with
leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25083f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> in the time of Elisha the prophet,
yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the
Syrian.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25084">28</sup> All
the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25085">29</sup> They got up,
drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on
which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25086">30</sup> But he walked
right through the crowd and went on his way.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25087">31</sup> Then he
went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began
to teach the people. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25088">32</sup> They were amazed at his teaching,
because his message had authority.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25089">33</sup> In
the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an
evil<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25089g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> spirit. He cried out at the top of
his voice, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25090">34</sup>
“Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to
destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25091">35</sup> “Be quiet!”</font> Jesus said sternly.
<font class='woj'>“Come out of him!”</font> Then the demon threw
the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25092">36</sup> All
the people were amazed and said to each other, “What is this
teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits
and they come out!” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25093">37</sup> And the news about him spread
throughout the surrounding area.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals Many</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25094">38</sup> Jesus
left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s
mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus
to help her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25095">39</sup>
So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got
up at once and began to wait on them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25096">40</sup> When
the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had
various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he
healed them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25097">41</sup>
Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the
Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak,
because they knew he was the Christ.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25097h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25098">42</sup> At
daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were
looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to
keep him from leaving them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25099">43</sup> But he said, <font class='woj'>“I must
preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also,
because that is why I was sent.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25100">44</sup> And he kept on preaching in the
synagogues of Judea.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
