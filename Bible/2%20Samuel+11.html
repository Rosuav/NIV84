<h4>2 Samuel 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">David and Bathsheba</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8261">1</sup> In the
spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out
with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed
the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8262">2</sup> One
evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of
the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was
very beautiful, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8263">3</sup>
and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “Isn’t
this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the
Hittite?” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8264">4</sup> Then
David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept
with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.)
Then<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8264a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> she went back home. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8265">5</sup> The woman conceived and
sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8266">6</sup> So
David sent this word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab
sent him to David. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8267">7</sup> When Uriah came to him, David asked him
how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8268">8</sup> Then David said
to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left
the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8269">9</sup> But Uriah slept
at the entrance to the palace with all his master’s servants and
did not go down to his house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8270">10</sup> When
David was told, “Uriah did not go home,” he asked him, “Haven’t you
just come from a distance? Why didn’t you go home?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8271">11</sup> Uriah
said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents,
and my master Joab and my lord’s men are camped in the open fields.
How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife?
As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8272">12</sup> Then
David said to him, “Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will
send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the
next. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8273">13</sup> At
David’s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him
drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among
his master’s servants; he did not go home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8274">14</sup> In the
morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8275">15</sup> In it he wrote,
“Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then
withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8276">16</sup> So
while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where
he knew the strongest defenders were. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8277">17</sup> When the men of the city came out and
fought against Joab, some of the men in David’s army fell;
moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8278">18</sup> Joab
sent David a full account of the battle. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8279">19</sup> He instructed the messenger: “When you
have finished giving the king this account of the battle,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8280">20</sup> the king’s
anger may flare up, and he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close
to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot arrows from
the wall? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8281">21</sup> Who
killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8281b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>? Didn’t a woman throw an upper
millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did
you get so close to the wall?’ If he asks you this, then say to
him, ‘Also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8282">22</sup> The
messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything
Joab had sent him to say. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8283">23</sup> The messenger said to David, “The men
overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove
them back to the entrance to the city gate. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8284">24</sup> Then the archers shot arrows at your
servants from the wall, and some of the king’s men died. Moreover,
your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8285">25</sup> David
told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t let this upset you;
the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against
the city and destroy it.’ Say this to encourage Joab.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8286">26</sup> When
Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8287">27</sup> After the time
of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she
became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done
displeased the LORD.</p>
