<h4>John 8</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26372">1</sup> But
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26373">2</sup> At dawn he appeared again in the temple
courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down
to teach them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26374">3</sup>
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught
in adultery. They made her stand before the group <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26375">4</sup> and said to Jesus,
“Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26376">5</sup> In the Law Moses commanded
us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26377">6</sup> They were using this question as a
trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jesus bent down and started to write on
the ground with his finger. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26378">7</sup> When they kept on questioning him, he
straightened up and said to them, <font class='woj'>“If any one of
you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at
her.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26379">8</sup>
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26380">9</sup> At
this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older
ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still
standing there. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26381">10</sup> Jesus straightened up and asked her,
<font class='woj'>“Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned
you?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26382">11</sup> “No
one, sir,” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Then neither do I condemn
you,”</font> Jesus declared. <font class='woj'>“Go now and leave
your life of sin.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Validity of Jesus’ Testimony</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26383">12</sup> When
Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, <font class='woj'>“I am
the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in
darkness, but will have the light of life.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26384">13</sup> The
Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own
witness; your testimony is not valid.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26385">14</sup> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“Even if I testify on my own behalf, my
testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am
going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am
going.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26386">15</sup> You judge by human standards; I pass
judgment on no one.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26387">16</sup> But if I do judge, my decisions are
right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent
me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26388">17</sup> In your own Law it is written that the
testimony of two men is valid.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26389">18</sup> I am one who testifies
for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent
me.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26390">19</sup> Then
they asked him, “Where is your father?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“You do not know me or my
Father,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj'>“If you knew me,
you would know my Father also.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26391">20</sup> He spoke these words while teaching in
the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no
one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26392">21</sup> Once
more Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“I am going away, and
you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you
cannot come.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26393">22</sup> This
made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says,
<font class='woj'>‘Where I go, you cannot come’</font>?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26394">23</sup> But
he continued, <font class='woj'>“You are from below; I am from
above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26395">24</sup> I told you that you would die in your
sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to
be,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26395a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> you will indeed die in your
sins.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26396">25</sup> “Who
are you?” they asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Just what I have been
claiming all along,”</font> Jesus replied. <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26397">26</sup> “I have
much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and
what I have heard from him I tell the world.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26398">27</sup> They
did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26399">28</sup> So Jesus said,
<font class='woj'>“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you
will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on
my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26400">29</sup> The one who sent me is with me; he has
not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26401">30</sup> Even as he
spoke, many put their faith in him.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Children of Abraham</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26402">31</sup> To the
Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“If you
hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26403">32</sup> Then you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26404">33</sup> They
answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26404b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and have never been slaves of anyone.
How can you say that we shall be set free?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26405">34</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, everyone who sins
is a slave to sin.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26406">35</sup> Now a slave has no permanent place
in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26407">36</sup> So if
the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26408">37</sup> I know
you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me,
because you have no room for my word.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26409">38</sup> I am
telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you do
what you have heard from your father.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26409c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26410">39</sup>
“Abraham is our father,” they answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“If you were Abraham’s
children,”</font> said Jesus, <font class='woj'>“then you
would<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26410d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> do the things Abraham did.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26411">40</sup> As it is, you are determined to kill
me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham
did not do such things.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26412">41</sup> You are doing the things
your own father does.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are not illegitimate children,” they
protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Children of the Devil</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26413">42</sup> Jesus
said to them, <font class='woj'>“If God were your Father, you would
love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my
own; but he sent me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26414">43</sup> Why is my language not clear to you?
Because you are unable to hear what I say.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26415">44</sup> You
belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your
father’s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding
to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks
his native language, for he is a liar and the father of
lies.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26416">45</sup> Yet because I tell the truth, you do
not believe me!</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26417">46</sup> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?
If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26418">47</sup> He who belongs to God hears what God
says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to
God.”</font>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Claims of Jesus About Himself</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26419">48</sup> The Jews
answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan
and demon-possessed?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26420">49</sup> “I am not possessed by a demon,”</font>
said Jesus, <font class='woj'>“but I honor my Father and you
dishonor me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26421">50</sup> I am not seeking glory for myself; but
there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26422">51</sup> I tell
you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see
death.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26423">52</sup> At
this the Jews exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed!
Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone
keeps your word, he will never taste death. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26424">53</sup> Are you greater than our father
Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you
are?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26425">54</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“If I glorify myself, my glory means
nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who
glorifies me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26426">55</sup> Though you do not know him, I know him.
If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him
and keep his word.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-26427">56</sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the
thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26428">57</sup> “You
are not yet fifty years old,” the Jews said to him, “and you have
seen Abraham!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26429">58</sup> “I tell you the truth,”</font> Jesus
answered, <font class='woj'>“before Abraham was born, I am!”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26430">59</sup> At this, they
picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away
from the temple grounds.</p>
