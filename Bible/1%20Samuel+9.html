<h4>1 Samuel 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Samuel Anoints Saul</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7393">1</sup> There was
a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel,
the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of
Benjamin. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7394">2</sup> He had
a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the
Israelites—a head taller than any of the others.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7395">3</sup> Now the
donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to
his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look
for the donkeys.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7396">4</sup> So he passed through the hill country of
Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find
them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys
were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin,
but they did not find them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7397">5</sup> When
they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was
with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking
about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7398">6</sup> But the
servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is
highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there
now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7399">7</sup> Saul
said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food
in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God.
What do we have?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7400">8</sup> The
servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a
shekel<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-7400a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of silver. I will give it to the
man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7401">9</sup> (Formerly in Israel, if a
man went to inquire of God, he would say, “Come, let us go to the
seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7402">10</sup>
“Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out
for the town where the man of God was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7403">11</sup> As
they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming
out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7404">12</sup> “He
is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come
to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high
place. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7405">13</sup> As soon
as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the
high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes,
because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are
invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this
time.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7406">14</sup> They
went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was
Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7407">15</sup> Now
the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel:
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7408">16</sup> “About this
time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin.
Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will deliver my people
from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked upon my people, for
their cry has reached me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7409">17</sup> When
Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, “This is the man
I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7410">18</sup> Saul
approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell
me where the seer’s house is?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7411">19</sup> “I am
the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place,
for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you
go and will tell you all that is in your heart. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7412">20</sup> As for the donkeys you
lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found.
And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and
all your father’s family?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7413">21</sup> Saul
answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of
Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe
of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7414">22</sup> Then
Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them
at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7415">23</sup> Samuel said to
the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you
to lay aside.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7416">24</sup> So the
cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of
Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat,
because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I
said, ‘I have invited guests.’” And Saul dined with Samuel that
day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7417">25</sup> After
they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with
Saul on the roof of his house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-7418">26</sup> They rose about daybreak and Samuel
called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your
way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-7419">27</sup> As they were
going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the
servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay
here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God.”</p>
