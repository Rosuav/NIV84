<h4>Jeremiah 32</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeremiah Buys a Field</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19733">1</sup> This is
the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19734">2</sup>
The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and
Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in
the royal palace of Judah.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19735">3</sup> Now
Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do
you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am
about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will
capture it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19736">4</sup>
Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hands of the
Babylonians<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19736a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> but will certainly be handed
over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face
and see him with his own eyes. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19737">5</sup> He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where
he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you
fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19738">6</sup>
Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19739">7</sup> Hanamel son of Shallum
your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at
Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to
buy it.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19740">8</sup> “Then,
just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the
courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the
territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and
possess it, buy it for yourself.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I knew that this was the word of the LORD;
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19741">9</sup> so I bought the
field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him
seventeen shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-19741b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of
silver. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19742">10</sup> I
signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the
silver on the scales. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19743">11</sup> I took the deed of purchase—the sealed
copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed
copy— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19744">12</sup> and I
gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the
presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed
the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the
guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19745">13</sup> “In
their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19746">14</sup> ‘This is what the LORD
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the
sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in
a clay jar so they will last a long time. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19747">15</sup> For this is what the LORD Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be
bought in this land.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19748">16</sup>
“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I
prayed to the LORD:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19749">17</sup> “Ah,
Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your
great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19750">18</sup> You show love
to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers’ sins into
the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God,
whose name is the LORD Almighty, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19751">19</sup> great are your purposes and mighty are
your deeds. Your eyes are open to all the ways of men; you reward
everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19752">20</sup> You performed
miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to
this day, both in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the
renown that is still yours. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19753">21</sup> You brought your people Israel out of
Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched
arm and with great terror. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19754">22</sup> You gave them this land you had sworn
to give their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19755">23</sup> They came in
and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your
law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought
all this disaster upon them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19756">24</sup> “See
how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the
sword, famine and plague, the city will be handed over to the
Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as
you now see. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19757">25</sup>
And though the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, you, O
Sovereign LORD, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the
transaction witnessed.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19758">26</sup> Then
the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19759">27</sup> “I am the LORD, the God of all mankind.
Is anything too hard for me? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19760">28</sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says:
I am about to hand this city over to the Babylonians and to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19761">29</sup> The Babylonians who are
attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn
it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to
anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out
drink offerings to other gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19762">30</sup> “The
people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight
from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing
but provoke me with what their hands have made, declares the LORD.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19763">31</sup> From the day
it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath
that I must remove it from my sight. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19764">32</sup> The people of Israel and Judah have
provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and
officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah and the
people of Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19765">33</sup> They turned their backs to me and not
their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not
listen or respond to discipline. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19766">34</sup> They set up their abominable idols in
the house that bears my Name and defiled it. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19767">35</sup> They built high places for Baal in
the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and
daughters<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19767c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> to Molech, though I never
commanded, nor did it enter my mind, that they should do such a
detestable thing and so make Judah sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19768">36</sup> “You
are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it
will be handed over to the king of Babylon’; but this is what the
LORD, the God of Israel, says: <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19769">37</sup> I will surely gather them from all the
lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I
will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19770">38</sup> They will be
my people, and I will be their God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19771">39</sup> I will give them singleness of heart
and action, so that they will always fear me for their own good and
the good of their children after them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19772">40</sup> I will make an everlasting covenant
with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire
them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19773">41</sup> I will rejoice
in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with
all my heart and soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19774">42</sup> “This
is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on
this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19775">43</sup> Once
more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a
desolate waste, without men or animals, for it has been handed over
to the Babylonians.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-19776">44</sup> Fields will be bought for silver, and
deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of
Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah
and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and
of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19776d" title=
