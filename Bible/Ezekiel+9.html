<h4>Ezekiel 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Idolaters Killed</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20624">1</sup> Then I
heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring the guards of the city
here, each with a weapon in his hand.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20625">2</sup> And I saw six men coming from the
direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly
weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a
writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze
altar.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20626">3</sup> Now
the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim,
where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then
the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit
at his side <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20627">4</sup> and
said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on
the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the
detestable things that are done in it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20628">5</sup> As I
listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and
kill, without showing pity or compassion. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20629">6</sup> Slaughter old men, young men and
maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the
mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who
were in front of the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20630">7</sup> Then
he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the
slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20631">8</sup> While they were
killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Ah,
Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of
Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20632">9</sup> He
answered me, “The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is
exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is
full of injustice. They say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land; the
LORD does not see.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-20633">10</sup> So I will not look on them with pity or
spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have
done.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20634">11</sup> Then
the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back
word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”</p>
