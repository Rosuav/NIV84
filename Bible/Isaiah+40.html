<h4>Isaiah 40</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Comfort for God’s People</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18422">1</sup> Comfort,
comfort my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says your God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18423">2</sup> Speak tenderly
to Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and proclaim to her<br>
that her hard service has been completed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that her sin has been paid for,<br>
that she has received from the LORD’s hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double for all her sins.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18424">3</sup> A
voice of one calling:<br>
“In the desert prepare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way for the LORD<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18424a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>;<br>
make straight in the wilderness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a highway for our God.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18424b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup><br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18425">4</sup> Every valley
shall be raised up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every mountain and hill made low;<br>
the rough ground shall become level,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rugged places a plain.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18426">5</sup> And the glory
of the LORD will be revealed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all mankind together will see it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18427">6</sup> A
voice says, “Cry out.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said, “What shall I cry?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All men are like grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all their glory is like the flowers of the
field.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18428">7</sup> The grass
withers and the flowers fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the breath of the LORD blows on them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the people are grass.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18429">8</sup> The grass
withers and the flowers fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the word of our God stands forever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18430">9</sup> You
who bring good tidings to Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go up on a high mountain.<br>
You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18430c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up your voice with a shout,<br>
lift it up, do not be afraid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say to the towns of Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here is your God!”<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18431">10</sup> See, the
Sovereign LORD comes with power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his arm rules for him.<br>
See, his reward is with him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his recompense accompanies him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18432">11</sup> He tends his
flock like a shepherd:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathers the lambs in his arms<br>
and carries them close to his heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gently leads those that have young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18433">12</sup> Who
has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or with the breadth of his hand marked off the
heavens?<br>
Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or weighed the mountains on the scales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hills in a balance?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18434">13</sup> Who has
understood the mind<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18434d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of the
LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or instructed him as his counselor?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18435">14</sup> Whom did the
LORD consult to enlighten him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who taught him the right way?<br>
Who was it that taught him knowledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or showed him the path of understanding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18436">15</sup>
Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are regarded as dust on the scales;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he weighs the islands as though they were fine
dust.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18437">16</sup> Lebanon is not
sufficient for altar fires,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18438">17</sup> Before him all
the nations are as nothing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are regarded by him as worthless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and less than nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18439">18</sup> To
whom, then, will you compare God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What image will you compare him to?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18440">19</sup> As for an
idol, a craftsman casts it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a goldsmith overlays it with gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fashions silver chains for it.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18441">20</sup> A man too poor
to present such an offering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selects wood that will not rot.<br>
He looks for a skilled craftsman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set up an idol that will not topple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18442">21</sup> Do
you not know?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not heard?<br>
Has it not been told you from the beginning?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not understood since the earth was
founded?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18443">22</sup> He sits
enthroned above the circle of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its people are like grasshoppers.<br>
He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spreads them out like a tent to live in.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18444">23</sup> He brings
princes to naught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reduces the rulers of this world to
nothing.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18445">24</sup> No sooner are
they planted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no sooner are they sown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no sooner do they take root in the ground,<br>
than he blows on them and they wither,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18446">25</sup> “To
whom will you compare me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18447">26</sup> Lift your eyes
and look to the heavens:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who created all these?<br>
He who brings out the starry host one by one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and calls them each by name.<br>
Because of his great power and mighty strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one of them is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18448">27</sup> Why
do you say, O Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and complain, O Israel,<br>
“My way is hidden from the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cause is disregarded by my God”?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18449">28</sup> Do you not
know?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not heard?<br>
The LORD is the everlasting God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Creator of the ends of the earth.<br>
He will not grow tired or weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his understanding no one can fathom.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18450">29</sup> He gives
strength to the weary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and increases the power of the weak.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18451">30</sup> Even youths
grow tired and weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and young men stumble and fall;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18452">31</sup> but those who
hope in the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will renew their strength.<br>
They will soar on wings like eagles;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will run and not grow weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will walk and not be faint.</p>
