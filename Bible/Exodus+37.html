<h4>Exodus 37</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Ark</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2606">1</sup> Bezalel
made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and
a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2606a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2607">2</sup> He overlaid it with pure gold, both
inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2608">3</sup> He cast four gold rings for
it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side
and two rings on the other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2609">4</sup> Then he made poles of acacia wood and
overlaid them with gold. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2610">5</sup> And he inserted the poles into the rings
on the sides of the ark to carry it.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2611">6</sup> He made
the atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a
cubit and a half wide.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2611b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2612">7</sup> Then he made two
cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2613">8</sup> He made one cherub on one
end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made
them of one piece with the cover. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2614">9</sup> The cherubim had their wings spread
upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each
other, looking toward the cover.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Table</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2615">10</sup>
They<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2615c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> made the table of acacia wood—two
cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2615d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2616">11</sup> Then they overlaid it with pure gold and
made a gold molding around it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2617">12</sup> They also made around it a rim a
handbreadth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2617e"
title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> wide and put a gold molding
on the rim. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2618">13</sup>
They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the
four corners, where the four legs were. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2619">14</sup> The rings were put close to the rim to
hold the poles used in carrying the table. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2620">15</sup> The poles for carrying the table were
made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2621">16</sup> And they made from pure
gold the articles for the table—its plates and dishes and bowls and
its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Lampstand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2622">17</sup> They made
the lampstand of pure gold and hammered it out, base and shaft; its
flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms were of one piece with it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2623">18</sup> Six branches
extended from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and
three on the other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2624">19</sup> Three cups shaped like almond flowers
with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch
and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2625">20</sup> And on the
lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and
blossoms. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2626">21</sup> One
bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the
lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud
under the third pair—six branches in all. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2627">22</sup> The buds and the branches were all of
one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2628">23</sup> They
made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of
pure gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2629">24</sup> They
made the lampstand and all its accessories from one
talent<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2629f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> of pure gold.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Altar of Incense</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2630">25</sup> They made
the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit
long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2630g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup>—its horns of one piece with it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2631">26</sup> They overlaid
the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a
gold molding around it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2632">27</sup> They made two gold rings below the
molding—two on opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2633">28</sup> They made the
poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2634">29</sup> They
also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant
incense—the work of a perfumer.</p>
