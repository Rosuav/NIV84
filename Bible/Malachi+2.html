<h4>Malachi 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Admonition for the Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23105">1</sup> “And now
this admonition is for you, O priests. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23106">2</sup> If you do not listen, and if you do not
set your heart to honor my name,” says the LORD Almighty, “I will
send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have
already cursed them, because you have not set your heart to honor
me.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23107">3</sup>
“Because of you I will rebuke<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23107a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> your
descendants<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23107b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>; I will spread on your faces
the offal from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried
off with it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23108">4</sup>
And you will know that I have sent you this admonition so that my
covenant with Levi may continue,” says the LORD Almighty.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23109">5</sup> “My covenant
was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him;
this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my
name. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23110">6</sup> True
instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his
lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many
from sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23111">7</sup> “For
the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his
mouth men should seek instruction—because he is the messenger of
the LORD Almighty. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23112">8</sup> But you have turned from the way and by
your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the
covenant with Levi,” says the LORD Almighty. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23113">9</sup> “So I have caused you to be despised
and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed
my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Judah Unfaithful</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23114">10</sup> Have we
not all one Father<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23114c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>? Did not
one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by
breaking faith with one another?
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23115">11</sup> Judah
has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel
and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the LORD
loves, by marrying the daughter of a foreign god. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23116">12</sup> As for the man who does
this, whoever he may be, may the LORD cut him off from the tents of
Jacob<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23116d" title=
"See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>—even though he brings offerings to
the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23117">13</sup>
Another thing you do: You flood the LORD’s altar with tears. You
weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings
or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23118">14</sup> You ask, “Why?” It is
because the LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife
of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though she
is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23119">15</sup> Has
not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And
why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23119e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> So guard yourself in your spirit, and
do not break faith with the wife of your youth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23120">16</sup> “I
hate divorce,” says the LORD God of Israel, “and I hate a man’s
covering himself<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23120f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> with
violence as well as with his garment,” says the LORD Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not
break faith.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Day of Judgment</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23121">17</sup> You have
wearied the LORD with your words.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How have we wearied him?” you ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By saying, “All who do evil are good in the
eyes of the LORD, and he is pleased with them” or “Where is the God
of justice?”</p>
