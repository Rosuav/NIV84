<h4>Matthew 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Man With Leprosy</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23347">1</sup> When he
came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23348">2</sup> A man with
leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23348a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> came and knelt before him and said,
“Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23349">3</sup> Jesus
reached out his hand and touched the man. <font class='woj'>“I am
willing,”</font> he said. <font class='woj'>“Be clean!”</font>
Immediately he was cured<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-23349b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of his
leprosy. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23350">4</sup> Then
Jesus said to him, <font class='woj'>“See that you don’t tell
anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift
Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Faith of the Centurion</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23351">5</sup> When
Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for
help. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23352">6</sup> “Lord,”
he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible
suffering.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23353">7</sup> Jesus
said to him, <font class='woj'>“I will go and heal him.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23354">8</sup> The
centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under
my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23355">9</sup> For I myself am
a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23356">10</sup> When
Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following
him, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, I have not found
anyone in Israel with such great faith.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23357">11</sup> I say to
you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take
their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-23358">12</sup> But the subjects of the kingdom will
be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23359">13</sup> Then
Jesus said to the centurion, <font class='woj'>“Go! It will be done
just as you believed it would.”</font> And his servant was healed
at that very hour.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Heals Many</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23360">14</sup> When
Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying
in bed with a fever. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23361">15</sup> He touched her hand and the fever left
her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23362">16</sup> When
evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him,
and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23363">17</sup> This was to
fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He took up our infirmities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carried our diseases.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23363c" title=
"See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Cost of Following Jesus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23364">18</sup> When
Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the
other side of the lake. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23365">19</sup> Then a teacher of the law came to him
and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23366">20</sup> Jesus
replied, <font class='woj'>“Foxes have holes and birds of the air
have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his
head.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23367">21</sup>
Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my
father.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23368">22</sup> But
Jesus told him, <font class='woj'>“Follow me, and let the dead bury
their own dead.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Calms the Storm</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23369">23</sup> Then he
got into the boat and his disciples followed him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23370">24</sup> Without warning, a
furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the
boat. But Jesus was sleeping. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23371">25</sup> The disciples went and woke him,
saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23372">26</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“You of little faith, why are you so
afraid?”</font> Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves,
and it was completely calm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23373">27</sup> The
men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the
winds and the waves obey him!”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Healing of Two Demon-possessed
Men</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23374">28</sup> When he
arrived at the other side in the region of the
Gadarenes,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23374d"
title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> two demon-possessed men coming
from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass
that way. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23375">29</sup>
“What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you
come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23376">30</sup> Some
distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23377">31</sup> The demons begged Jesus,
“If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23378">32</sup> He
said to them, <font class='woj'>“Go!”</font> So they came out and
went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank
into the lake and died in the water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23379">33</sup> Those tending the pigs ran off, went
into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to
the demon-possessed men. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-23380">34</sup> Then the whole town went out to meet
Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their
region.</p>
