<h5 class="passage-header">Amaziah King of Judah</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9898">1</sup> In the
second year of Jehoash<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9898a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> son of
Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began
to reign. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9899">2</sup> He was
twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin; she
was from Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9900">3</sup> He did what was right in the eyes of the
LORD, but not as his father David had done. In everything he
followed the example of his father Joash. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9901">4</sup> The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense
there.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9902">5</sup> After
the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed the officials who
had murdered his father the king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9903">6</sup> Yet he did not put the sons of the
assassins to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book
of the Law of Moses where the LORD commanded: “Fathers shall not be
put to death for their children, nor children put to death for
their fathers; each is to die for his own sins.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9903b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9904">7</sup> He was
the one who defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt
and captured Sela in battle, calling it Joktheel, the name it has
to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9905">8</sup> Then
Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of
Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge: “Come, meet me face to
face.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9906">9</sup> But
Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle
in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your
daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came
along and trampled the thistle underfoot. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9907">10</sup> You have indeed defeated Edom and now
you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask
for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah
also?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9908">11</sup>
Amaziah, however, would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel
attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth
Shemesh in Judah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9909">12</sup> Judah was routed by Israel, and every
man fled to his home. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9910">13</sup> Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth
Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of
Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about
six hundred feet long.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9910c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9911">14</sup> He took all the
gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of the
LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace. He also took
hostages and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9912">15</sup> As for
the other events of the reign of Jehoash, what he did and his
achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are
they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9913">16</sup> Jehoash rested
with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of
Israel. And Jeroboam his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9914">17</sup>
Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after
the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9915">18</sup> As for the other events of
Amaziah’s reign, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9916">19</sup> They
conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but
they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9917">20</sup> He was brought
back by horse and was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the
City of David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9918">21</sup> Then
all the people of Judah took Azariah,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9918d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> who was sixteen years old, and
made him king in place of his father Amaziah. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-9919">22</sup> He was the one who rebuilt Elath and
restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jeroboam II King of Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9920">23</sup> In the
fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son
of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned
forty-one years. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9921">24</sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD and
did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat,
which he had caused Israel to commit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9922">25</sup> He was the one who restored the
boundaries of Israel from Lebo<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9922e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> Hamath
to the Sea of the Arabah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-9922f" title="Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> in
accordance with the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, spoken
through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath
Hepher.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9923">26</sup> The
LORD had seen how bitterly everyone in Israel, whether slave or
free, was suffering; there was no one to help them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9924">27</sup> And since the LORD had not
said he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, he
saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-9925">28</sup> As for
the other events of Jeroboam’s reign, all he did, and his military
achievements, including how he recovered for Israel both Damascus
and Hamath, which had belonged to Yaudi,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-9925g" title=
"Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> are they not written in the book
of the annals of the kings of Israel? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-9926">29</sup> Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the
kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son succeeded him as king.</p>
