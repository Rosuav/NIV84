<h4>Exodus 30</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Altar of Incense</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2384">1</sup> “Make an
altar of acacia wood for burning incense. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2385">2</sup> It is to be square, a cubit long and a
cubit wide, and two cubits high<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2385a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>—its
horns of one piece with it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2386">3</sup> Overlay the top and all the sides and the
horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2387">4</sup> Make two gold
rings for the altar below the molding—two on opposite sides—to hold
the poles used to carry it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2388">5</sup> Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay
them with gold. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2389">6</sup>
Put the altar in front of the curtain that is before the ark of the
Testimony—before the atonement cover that is over the
Testimony—where I will meet with you.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2390">7</sup> “Aaron
must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends
the lamps. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2391">8</sup> He
must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so
incense will burn regularly before the LORD for the generations to
come. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2392">9</sup> Do not
offer on this altar any other incense or any burnt offering or
grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2393">10</sup> Once a year Aaron shall
make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made
with the blood of the atoning sin offering for the generations to
come. It is most holy to the LORD.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Atonement Money</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2394">11</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2395">12</sup> “When you take a census of the
Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for
his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on
them when you number them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2396">13</sup> Each one who crosses over to those
already counted is to give a half shekel,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2396b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> according to the sanctuary shekel,
which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the
LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2397">14</sup> All who
cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering
to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2398">15</sup>
The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are
not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone
for your lives. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2399">16</sup>
Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the
service of the Tent of Meeting. It will be a memorial for the
Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives.”
<h5 class="passage-header">Basin for Washing</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2400">17</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2401">18</sup> “Make a bronze basin, with its bronze
stand, for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the
altar, and put water in it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2402">19</sup> Aaron and his sons are to wash their
hands and feet with water from it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2403">20</sup> Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting,
they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when
they approach the altar to minister by presenting an offering made
to the LORD by fire, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2404">21</sup> they shall wash their hands and feet so
that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron
and his descendants for the generations to come.”
<h5 class="passage-header">Anointing Oil</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2405">22</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2406">23</sup> “Take the following fine spices: 500
shekels<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2406c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of liquid myrrh, half as much
(that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of
fragrant cane, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2407">24</sup>
500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a
hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2407d" title=
"Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of olive oil. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2408">25</sup> Make these into a sacred
anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be
the sacred anointing oil. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2409">26</sup> Then use it to anoint the Tent of
Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2410">27</sup> the table and all its articles, the
lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2411">28</sup> the altar of burnt
offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2412">29</sup> You shall
consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches
them will be holy.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2413">30</sup>
“Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me
as priests. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2414">31</sup> Say
to the Israelites, ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the
generations to come. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2415">32</sup> Do not pour it on men’s bodies and do
not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred, and you are
to consider it sacred. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2416">33</sup> Whoever makes perfume like it and
whoever puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from
his people.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Incense</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2417">34</sup> Then the
LORD said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and
galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2418">35</sup> and make a fragrant blend
of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and
sacred. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2419">36</sup> Grind
some of it to powder and place it in front of the Testimony in the
Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy
to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2420">37</sup> Do not
make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy
to the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2421">38</sup>
Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off
from his people.”
