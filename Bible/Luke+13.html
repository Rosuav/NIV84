<h4>Luke 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Repent or Perish</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25512">1</sup> Now there
were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans
whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25513">2</sup> Jesus answered,
<font class='woj'>“Do you think that these Galileans were worse
sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this
way?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25514">3</sup> I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25515">4</sup> Or those eighteen who died
when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more
guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25516">5</sup> I tell
you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25517">6</sup> Then
he told this parable: <font class='woj'>“A man had a fig tree,
planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but
did not find any.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25518">7</sup> So he said to the man who took care
of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for
fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why
should it use up the soil?’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25519">8</sup> “‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone
for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25520">9</sup> If it bears fruit next year, fine! If
not, then cut it down.’”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Crippled Woman Healed on the
Sabbath</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25521">10</sup> On a
Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25522">11</sup> and a woman was there who
had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over
and could not straighten up at all. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25523">12</sup> When Jesus saw her, he called her
forward and said to her, <font class='woj'>“Woman, you are set free
from your infirmity.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25524">13</sup> Then he put his hands on her, and
immediately she straightened up and praised God.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25525">14</sup>
Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue
ruler said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and
be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25526">15</sup> The
Lord answered him, <font class='woj'>“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each
of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and
lead it out to give it water?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25527">16</sup> Then should not this
woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for
eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound
her?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25528">17</sup> When
he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people
were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the
Yeast</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25529">18</sup> Then
Jesus asked, <font class='woj'>“What is the kingdom of God like?
What shall I compare it to?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25530">19</sup> It is like a mustard
seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and
became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its
branches.”</font>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25531">20</sup> Again
he asked, <font class='woj'>“What shall I compare the kingdom of
God to?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25532">21</sup> It is like yeast that a woman took and
mixed into a large amount<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-25532a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of flour
until it worked all through the dough.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Narrow Door</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25533">22</sup> Then
Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his
way to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25534">23</sup> Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a
few people going to be saved?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to them, <font class='woj'><sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25535">24</sup> “Make every effort to
enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try
to enter and will not be able to.</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25536">25</sup> Once the
owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand
outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for
us.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“But he will answer, ‘I
don’t know you or where you come from.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25537">26</sup> “Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank
with you, and you taught in our streets.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25538">27</sup> “But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you
or where you come from. Away from me, all you
evildoers!’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25539">28</sup> “There will be weeping there, and
gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all
the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown
out.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25540">29</sup> People will come from east and west and
north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the
kingdom of God.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25541">30</sup> Indeed there are those who are last who
will be first, and first who will be last.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus’ Sorrow for Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25542">31</sup> At that
time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this
place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25543">32</sup> He
replied, <font class='woj'>“Go tell that fox, ‘I will drive out
demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I
will reach my goal.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-25544">33</sup> In any case, I must keep going today
and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside
Jerusalem!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-25545">34</sup> “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill
the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed
to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under
her wings, but you were not willing!</font> <font class=
'woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25546">35</sup> Look,
your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me
again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25546b" title=
