<h4>Acts 11</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Peter Explains His Actions</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27297">1</sup> The
apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles
also had received the word of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27298">2</sup> So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the
circumcised believers criticized him <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27299">3</sup> and said, “You went into the house of
uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27300">4</sup> Peter
began and explained everything to them precisely as it had
happened: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27301">5</sup> “I
was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I
saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its
four corners, and it came down to where I was. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27302">6</sup> I looked into it and saw
four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds
of the air. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27303">7</sup>
Then I heard a voice telling me, <font class='woj'>‘Get up, Peter.
Kill and eat.’</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27304">8</sup> “I
replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever
entered my mouth.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27305">9</sup> “The
voice spoke from heaven a second time, <font class='woj'>‘Do not
call anything impure that God has made clean.’</font> <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27306">10</sup> This happened three
times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27307">11</sup>
“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped
at the house where I was staying. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27308">12</sup> The Spirit told me to have no
hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with
me, and we entered the man’s house. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27309">13</sup> He told us how he had seen an angel
appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called
Peter. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27310">14</sup> He will
bring you a message through which you and all your household will
be saved.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27311">15</sup> “As I
began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us
at the beginning. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27312">16</sup> Then I remembered what the Lord had
said: <font class='woj'>‘John baptized with<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27312a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit.’</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27313">17</sup> So if God gave them the same gift as he
gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think
that I could oppose God?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27314">18</sup> When
they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God,
saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto
life.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Church in Antioch</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27315">19</sup> Now
those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with
Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling
the message only to Jews. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27316">20</sup> Some of them, however, men from Cyprus
and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also,
telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27317">21</sup> The Lord’s hand was with
them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27318">22</sup> News
of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent
Barnabas to Antioch. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27319">23</sup> When he arrived and saw the evidence of
the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain
true to the Lord with all their hearts. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27320">24</sup> He was a good man, full of the Holy
Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the
Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27321">25</sup> Then
Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27322">26</sup> and when he found him, he brought him
to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the
church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were
called Christians first at Antioch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27323">27</sup>
During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27324">28</sup> One of them,
named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a
severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This
happened during the reign of Claudius.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27325">29</sup> The disciples, each according to his
ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27326">30</sup> This they did,
sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p>
