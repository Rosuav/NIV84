<h4>Deuteronomy 31</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joshua to Succeed Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5730">1</sup> Then Moses
went out and spoke these words to all Israel: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5731">2</sup> “I am now a hundred and twenty years
old and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has said to me,
‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5732">3</sup> The LORD your God himself will cross over
ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you
will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over
ahead of you, as the LORD said. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5733">4</sup> And the LORD will do to them what he did
to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along
with their land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5734">5</sup>
The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that
I have commanded you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5735">6</sup> Be strong and courageous. Do not be
afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes
with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5736">7</sup> Then
Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all
Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people
into the land that the LORD swore to their forefathers to give
them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5737">8</sup> The LORD himself
goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor
forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Reading of the Law</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5738">9</sup> So Moses
wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi,
who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the
elders of Israel. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5739">10</sup> Then Moses commanded them: “At the end
of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the
Feast of Tabernacles, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5740">11</sup> when all Israel comes to appear before
the LORD your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this
law before them in their hearing. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5741">12</sup> Assemble the people—men, women and
children, and the aliens living in your towns—so they can listen
and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the
words of this law. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5742">13</sup> Their children, who do not know this
law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as
you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
<h5 class="passage-header">Israel’s Rebellion Predicted</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5743">14</sup> The LORD
said to Moses, “Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and
present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission
him.” So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent
of Meeting.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5744">15</sup> Then
the LORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud
stood over the entrance to the Tent. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5745">16</sup> And the LORD said to Moses: “You are
going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon
prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are
entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5746">17</sup> On that
day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my
face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and
difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask,
‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with
us?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5747">18</sup> And I will
certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness
in turning to other gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5748">19</sup> “Now
write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites
and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against
them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5749">20</sup> When I
have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the
land I promised on oath to their forefathers, and when they eat
their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship
them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5750">21</sup> And when many disasters and
difficulties come upon them, this song will testify against them,
because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what
they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I
promised them on oath.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5751">22</sup> So Moses wrote down this song that day
and taught it to the Israelites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5752">23</sup> The
LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and
courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I
promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5753">24</sup> After
Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from
beginning to end, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5754">25</sup> he gave this command to the Levites who
carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD: <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-5755">26</sup> “Take this Book of the Law and place
it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it
will remain as a witness against you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-5756">27</sup> For I know how rebellious and
stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD
while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel
after I die! <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5757">28</sup>
Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your
officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and
call heaven and earth to testify against them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5758">29</sup> For I know that after my
death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the
way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall upon
you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and provoke
him to anger by what your hands have made.”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Song of Moses</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-5759">30</sup> And Moses
recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing
of the whole assembly of Israel:</div>
