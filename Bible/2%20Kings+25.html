<h4>2 Kings 25</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10224">1</sup> So in
the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth
month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem
with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege
works all around it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10225">2</sup> The city was kept under siege until the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10226">3</sup> By the ninth day of the
fourth<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10226a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> month the famine in the city had
become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10227">4</sup> Then the city
wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through
the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the
Babylonians<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10227b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> were surrounding the city.
They fled toward the Arabah,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10227c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10228">5</sup> but the
Babylonian<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10228d"
title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> army pursued the king and
overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were
separated from him and scattered, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10229">6</sup> and he was captured. He was taken to the
king of Babylon at Riblah, where sentence was pronounced on him.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10230">7</sup> They killed the
sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound
him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10231">8</sup> On the
seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10232">9</sup> He
set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the
houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10233">10</sup> The whole
Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke
down the walls around Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10234">11</sup> Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard
carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with
the rest of the populace and those who had gone over to the king of
Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10235">12</sup> But
the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to
work the vineyards and fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10236">13</sup> The
Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the
bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried the
bronze to Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10237">14</sup> They also took away the pots, shovels,
wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the
temple service. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10238">15</sup> The commander of the imperial guard
took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—all that were made of
pure gold or silver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10239">16</sup> The
bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the movable stands, which
Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be
weighed. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10240">17</sup> Each
pillar was twenty-seven feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10240e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> high.
The bronze capital on top of one pillar was four and a half
feet<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-10240f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> high and was decorated with a
network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar,
with its network, was similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10241">18</sup> The
commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest,
Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10242">19</sup> Of those still
in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men and
five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief
officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty
of his men who were found in the city. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10243">20</sup> Nebuzaradan the commander took them all
and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10244">21</sup> There at Riblah, in the
land of Hamath, the king had them executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Judah went into captivity, away from her
land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10245">22</sup>
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam,
the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in
Judah. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10246">23</sup> When
all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon
had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at
Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son
of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite,
and their men. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10247">24</sup>
Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be
afraid of the Babylonian officials,” he said. “Settle down in the
land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with
you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10248">25</sup> In
the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of
Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and
assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians
who were with him at Mizpah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10249">26</sup> At this, all the people from the least
to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for
fear of the Babylonians.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jehoiachin Released</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10250">27</sup> In the
thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in
the year Evil-Merodach<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-10250g" title="Vea nota al pie g">g</a>]</sup> became
king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin from prison on the
twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10251">28</sup> He spoke kindly to him and gave him a
seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with
him in Babylon. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-10252">29</sup> So Jehoiachin put aside his prison
clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s
table. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-10253">30</sup> Day by
day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he
lived.
