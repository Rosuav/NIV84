<h4>Leviticus 5</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2832">1</sup> “‘If a
person sins because he does not speak up when he hears a public
charge to testify regarding something he has seen or learned about,
he will be held responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2833">2</sup> “‘Or if
a person touches anything ceremonially unclean—whether the
carcasses of unclean wild animals or of unclean livestock or of
unclean creatures that move along the ground—even though he is
unaware of it, he has become unclean and is guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2834">3</sup> “‘Or if
he touches human uncleanness—anything that would make him
unclean—even though he is unaware of it, when he learns of it he
will be guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2835">4</sup> “‘Or if
a person thoughtlessly takes an oath to do anything, whether good
or evil—in any matter one might carelessly swear about—even though
he is unaware of it, in any case when he learns of it he will be
guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2836">5</sup> “‘When
anyone is guilty in any of these ways, he must confess in what way
he has sinned <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2837">6</sup>
and, as a penalty for the sin he has committed, he must bring to
the LORD a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering;
and the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2838">7</sup> “‘If he
cannot afford a lamb, he is to bring two doves or two young pigeons
to the LORD as a penalty for his sin—one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2839">8</sup> He is to bring them to the priest, who
shall first offer the one for the sin offering. He is to wring its
head from its neck, not severing it completely, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2840">9</sup> and is to sprinkle some of
the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar; the
rest of the blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. It
is a sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2841">10</sup> The priest shall then offer the other as
a burnt offering in the prescribed way and make atonement for him
for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2842">11</sup> “‘If,
however, he cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, he is to
bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah<sup class=

He must not put oil or incense on it, because it is a sin offering.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2843">12</sup> He is to bring
it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial
portion and burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made to
the LORD by fire. It is a sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2844">13</sup> In this way the priest will make
atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed, and he
will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the
priest, as in the case of the grain offering.’”</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Guilt Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2845">14</sup> The LORD
said to Moses: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2846">15</sup>
“When a person commits a violation and sins unintentionally in
regard to any of the LORD’s holy things, he is to bring to the LORD
as a penalty a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the
proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary
shekel.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2846b" title=

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2847">16</sup> He must make
restitution for what he has failed to do in regard to the holy
things, add a fifth of the value to that and give it all to the
priest, who will make atonement for him with the ram as a guilt
offering, and he will be forgiven.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2848">17</sup> “If a
person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD’s
commands, even though he does not know it, he is guilty and will be
held responsible. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2849">18</sup> He is to bring to the priest as a guilt
offering a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper
value. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the
wrong he has committed unintentionally, and he will be forgiven.
