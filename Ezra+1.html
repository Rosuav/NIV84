<h5 class="passage-header">Cyrus Helps the Exiles to Return</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12018">1</sup> In the
first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of
the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king
of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it
in writing:
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12019">2</sup> “This
is what Cyrus king of Persia says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me
all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a
temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12020">3</sup> Anyone of his people among you—may his
God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build
the temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in
Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12021">4</sup> And
the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to
provide him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and
with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12022">5</sup> Then
the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and
Levites—everyone whose heart God had moved—prepared to go up and
build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12023">6</sup> All their neighbors assisted them with
articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with
valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12024">7</sup> Moreover, King
Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD,
which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed
in the temple of his god.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12025">8</sup> Cyrus king of
Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted
them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12026">9</sup> This
was the inventory:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gold dishes 30</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver dishes 1,000</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver pans<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12028">11</sup> In
all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar
brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to
Jerusalem.</p>
