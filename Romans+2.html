<h4>Romans 2</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">God’s Righteous Judgment</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27949">1</sup> You,
therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else,
for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning
yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27950">2</sup> Now we know
that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on
truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27951">3</sup> So when
you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things,
do you think you will escape God’s judgment? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27952">4</sup> Or do you show contempt for the
riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that
God’s kindness leads you toward repentance?
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27953">5</sup> But
because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are
storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when
his righteous judgment will be revealed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27954">6</sup> God “will give to each person according
to what he has done.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27954a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27955">7</sup> To those who by
persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he
will give eternal life. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27956">8</sup> But for those who are self-seeking and
who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and
anger. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27957">9</sup> There
will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil:
first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27958">10</sup> but glory, honor and peace for everyone
who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27959">11</sup> For God does not show
favoritism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27960">12</sup> All
who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and
all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27961">13</sup> For it is not those who
hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who
obey the law who will be declared righteous. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27962">14</sup> (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not
have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a
law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27963">15</sup> since they
show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts,
their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now
accusing, now even defending them.) <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27964">16</sup> This will take place on the day when
God will judge men’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel
declares.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Jews and the Law</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27965">17</sup> Now you,
if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about
your relationship to God; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27966">18</sup> if you know his will and approve of
what is superior because you are instructed by the law; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27967">19</sup> if you are convinced that
you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the
dark, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27968">20</sup> an
instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have
in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27969">21</sup> you, then, who teach
others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing,
do you steal? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27970">22</sup>
You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit
adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27971">23</sup> You who brag about the
law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27972">24</sup> As it is written: “God’s name is
blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27972b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27973">25</sup>
Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the
law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27974">26</sup> If those who
are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be
regarded as though they were circumcised? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27975">27</sup> The one who is not circumcised
physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though
you have the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27975c"
title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> written code and circumcision,
are a lawbreaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27976">28</sup> A man
is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision
merely outward and physical. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27977">29</sup> No, a man is a Jew if he is one
inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the
Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise is not from
men, but from God.</p>
