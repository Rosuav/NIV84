<p><h4>Matthew 21</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Triumphal Entry</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23826">1</sup> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23827">2</sup> saying to them, <font class='woj'>“Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23828">3</sup> If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23829">4</sup> This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23830">5</sup> “Say to the Daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘See, your king comes to you, <br />gentle and riding on a donkey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23830a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23831">6</sup> The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23832">7</sup> They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23833">8</sup> A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23834">9</sup> The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hosanna<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23834b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> to the Son of David!” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23834c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hosanna<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23834d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> in the highest!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23835">10</sup> When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23836">11</sup> The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” <h5 class="passage-header">Jesus at the Temple</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23837">12</sup> Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23838">13</sup> “It is written,”</font> he said to them, <font class='woj'>“‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23838e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> but you are making it a ‘den of robbers.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23838f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23839">14</sup> The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23840">15</sup> But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23841">16</sup> “Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Yes,”</font> replied Jesus, <font class='woj'>“have you never read,</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘From the lips of children and infants</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>you have ordained praise’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23841g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23842">17</sup> And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. <h5 class="passage-header">The Fig Tree Withers</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23843">18</sup> Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23844">19</sup> Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, <font class='woj'>“May you never bear fruit again!”</font> Immediately the tree withered. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23845">20</sup> When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23846">21</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23847">22</sup> If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23848">23</sup> Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23849">24</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23850">25</sup> John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23851">26</sup> But if we say, ‘From men’—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23852">27</sup> So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, <font class='woj'>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Two Sons</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23853">28</sup> “What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23854">29</sup> “‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23855">30</sup> “Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23856">31</sup> “Which of the two did what his father wanted?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The first,” they answered. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23857">32</sup> For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Tenants</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23858">33</sup> “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23859">34</sup> When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23860">35</sup> “The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23861">36</sup> Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23862">37</sup> Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23863">38</sup> “But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23864">39</sup> So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23865">40</sup> “Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23866">41</sup> “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23867">42</sup> Jesus said to them, <font class='woj'>“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“‘The stone the builders rejected</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>has become the capstone<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23867h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup>;</font> <br /><font class='woj'>the Lord has done this,</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>and it is marvelous in our eyes’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23867i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup>?</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23868">43</sup> “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23869">44</sup> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23869j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23870">45</sup> When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23871">46</sup> They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-23830a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-23830" title="Go to Matthew 21:5">Matthew 21:5</a> Zech. 9:9</li>
