Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25652">8</sup> Would he not rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25653">9</sup> Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25654">10</sup> So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Ten Healed of Leprosy</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25655">11</sup> Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25656">12</sup> As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25656a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> met him. They stood at a distance <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25657">13</sup> and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25658">14</sup> When he saw them, he said, <font class='woj'>“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</font> And as they went, they were cleansed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25659">15</sup> One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25660">16</sup> He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25661">17</sup> Jesus asked, <font class='woj'>“Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25662">18</sup> Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25663">19</sup> Then he said to him, <font class='woj'>“Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">The Coming of the Kingdom of God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25664">20</sup> Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25665">21</sup> nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is within<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25665b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> you.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25666">22</sup> Then he said to his disciples, <font class='woj'>“The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25667">23</sup> Men will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25668">24</sup> For the Son of Man in his day<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-25668c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25669">25</sup> But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25670">26</sup> “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25671">27</sup> People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25672">28</sup> “It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25673">29</sup> But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25674">30</sup> “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-25675">31</sup> On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them.
