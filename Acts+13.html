<h4>Acts 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Barnabas and Saul Sent Off</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27352">1</sup> In the
church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought
up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27353">2</sup> While they were worshiping the Lord and
fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul
for the work to which I have called them.” <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27354">3</sup> So after they had fasted and prayed,
they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
<h5 class="passage-header">On Cyprus</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27355">4</sup> The two
of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to
Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27356">5</sup> When they arrived at Salamis, they
proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with
them as their helper.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27357">6</sup> They
traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There
they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27358">7</sup> who was an
attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an
intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to
hear the word of God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27359">8</sup> But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is
what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul
from the faith. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27360">9</sup>
Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit,
looked straight at Elymas and said, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27361">10</sup> “You are a child of the devil and an
enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of
deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways
of the Lord? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27362">11</sup>
Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind,
and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately mist and darkness came over him,
and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27363">12</sup> When the
proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at
the teaching about the Lord.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">In Pisidian Antioch</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27364">13</sup> From
Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where
John left them to return to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27365">14</sup> From Perga they went on to Pisidian
Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27366">15</sup> After the
reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent
word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a message of
encouragement for the people, please speak.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27367">16</sup>
Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Men of Israel
and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27368">17</sup> The God of the people of
Israel chose our fathers; he made the people prosper during their
stay in Egypt, with mighty power he led them out of that country,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27369">18</sup> he endured
their conduct<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27369a"
title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for about forty years in the
desert, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27370">19</sup> he
overthrew seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people
as their inheritance. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27371">20</sup> All this took about 450 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After this, God gave them judges until the
time of Samuel the prophet. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27372">21</sup> Then the people asked for a king, and
he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled
forty years. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27373">22</sup>
After removing Saul, he made David their king. He testified
concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own
heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27374">23</sup> “From
this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus,
as he promised. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27375">24</sup> Before the coming of Jesus, John
preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27376">25</sup> As John was
completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you think I am? I am not that
one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy
to untie.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27377">26</sup>
“Brothers, children of Abraham, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is
to us that this message of salvation has been sent. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27378">27</sup> The people of Jerusalem
and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him
they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every
Sabbath. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27379">28</sup>
Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked
Pilate to have him executed. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27380">29</sup> When they had carried out all that was
written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in
a tomb. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27381">30</sup> But
God raised him from the dead, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27382">31</sup> and for many days he was seen by those
who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now
his witnesses to our people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27383">32</sup> “We
tell you the good news: What God promised our fathers <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27384">33</sup> he has fulfilled for us,
their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second
Psalm:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘You are my Son;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today I have become your Father.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27384b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27384c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27385">34</sup> The
fact that God raised him from the dead, never to decay, is stated
in these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings
promised to David.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27385d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27386">35</sup> So it
is stated elsewhere:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘You will not let your Holy One see
decay.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27386e" title=
"See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27387">36</sup> “For
when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell
asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27388">37</sup> But the one
whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27389">38</sup>
“Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the
forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27390">39</sup> Through him everyone who believes is
justified from everything you could not be justified from by the
law of Moses. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27391">40</sup>
Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to
you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27392">41</sup>
“‘Look, you scoffers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonder and perish,<br>
for I am going to do something in your days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you would never believe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if someone told you.’<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27392f" title=
"See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27393">42</sup> As
Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited
them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27394">43</sup> When the
congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to
Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged
them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27395">44</sup> On
the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of
the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27396">45</sup> When
the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked
abusively against what Paul was saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27397">46</sup> Then
Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word
of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider
yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27398">47</sup> For this is
what the Lord has commanded us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I have made you<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-27398g" title=
"See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> a light for the Gentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27398h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> may bring
salvation to the ends of the earth.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-27398i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27399">48</sup> When
the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the
Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27400">49</sup> The
word of the Lord spread through the whole region. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-27401">50</sup> But the Jews incited the
God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city.
They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled
them from their region. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-27402">51</sup> So they shook the dust from their feet
in protest against them and went to Iconium. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-27403">52</sup> And the disciples were filled with
joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>
