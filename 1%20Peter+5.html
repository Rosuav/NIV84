<h4>1 Peter 5</h4><h5 class="passage-header">To Elders and Young Men</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30451">1</sup> To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30452">2</sup> Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30453">3</sup> not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30454">4</sup> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30455">5</sup> Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God opposes the proud <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gives grace to the humble.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30455a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30456">6</sup> Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30457">7</sup> Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30458">8</sup> Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30459">9</sup> Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30460">10</sup> And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30461">11</sup> To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen. <h5 class="passage-header">Final Greetings</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30462">12</sup> With the help of Silas,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30462b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30463">13</sup> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30464">14</sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace to all of you who are in Christ. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-30455a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-30455" title="Ir a 1 Peter 5:5">1 Peter 5:5</a> Prov. 3:34</li>
