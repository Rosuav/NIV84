<h4>Exodus 36</h4>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2568">1</sup> So
Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has
given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of
constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has
commanded.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2569">2</sup> Then
Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom
the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the
work. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2570">3</sup> They
received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to
carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people
continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2571">4</sup> So all the
skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left
their work <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2572">5</sup> and
said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing
the work the LORD commanded to be done.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2573">6</sup> Then
Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp:
“No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the
sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2574">7</sup> because what
they already had was more than enough to do all the work.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Tabernacle</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2575">8</sup> All the
skilled men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains
of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with
cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2576">9</sup> All the curtains were the
same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2576a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2577">10</sup> They joined five of the curtains
together and did the same with the other five. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2578">11</sup> Then they made loops of
blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the
same was done with the end curtain in the other set. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2579">12</sup> They also made fifty loops
on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set,
with the loops opposite each other. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2580">13</sup> Then they made fifty gold clasps and
used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the
tabernacle was a unit.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2581">14</sup> They
made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven
altogether. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2582">15</sup> All
eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four
cubits wide.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2582b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2583">16</sup> They joined five of the curtains into
one set and the other six into another set. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2584">17</sup> Then they made fifty loops along the
edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the
end curtain in the other set. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2585">18</sup> They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten
the tent together as a unit. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2586">19</sup> Then they made for the tent a covering
of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea
cows.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2586c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2587">20</sup> They
made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2588">21</sup> Each frame was ten cubits
long and a cubit and a half wide,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2588d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2589">22</sup> with two
projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of
the tabernacle in this way. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2590">23</sup> They made twenty frames for the south
side of the tabernacle <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2591">24</sup> and made forty silver bases to go under
them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2592">25</sup> For the other
side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2593">26</sup> and forty
silver bases—two under each frame. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2594">27</sup> They made six frames for the far end,
that is, the west end of the tabernacle, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2595">28</sup> and two frames were made for the corners
of the tabernacle at the far end. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2596">29</sup> At these two corners the frames were
double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a
single ring; both were made alike. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2597">30</sup> So there were eight frames and sixteen
silver bases—two under each frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2598">31</sup> They
also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side
of the tabernacle, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2599">32</sup> five for those on the other side, and
five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2600">33</sup> They made the
center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle
of the frames. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2601">34</sup>
They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the
crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2602">35</sup> They
made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely
twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2603">36</sup> They made four
posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made
gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2604">37</sup> For the entrance to the
tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and
finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer; <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2605">38</sup> and they made five posts
with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their
bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.</p>
