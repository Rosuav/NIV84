<p><h4>Romans 11</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Remnant of Israel</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28196">1</sup> I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28197">2</sup> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28198">3</sup> “Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28198a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28199">4</sup> And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28199b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28200">5</sup> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28201">6</sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28201c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28202">7</sup> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28203">8</sup> as it is written: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God gave them a spirit of stupor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes so that they could not see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ears so that they could not hear, <br />to this very day.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28203d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28204">9</sup> And David says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“May their table become a snare and a trap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stumbling block and a retribution for them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28205">10</sup> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their backs be bent forever.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28205e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> <h5 class="passage-header">Ingrafted Branches</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28206">11</sup> Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28207">12</sup> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28208">13</sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28209">14</sup> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28210">15</sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28211">16</sup> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28212">17</sup> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28213">18</sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28214">19</sup> You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28215">20</sup> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28216">21</sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28217">22</sup> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28218">23</sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28219">24</sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <h5 class="passage-header">All Israel Will Be Saved</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28220">25</sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28221">26</sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The deliverer will come from Zion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28222">27</sup> And this is<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28222f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> my covenant with them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I take away their sins.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28222g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28223">28</sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28224">29</sup> for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28225">30</sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28226">31</sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28226h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28227">32</sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <h5 class="passage-header">Doxology</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28228">33</sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28228i" title="See footnote i">i</a>]</sup> knowledge of God! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How unsearchable his judgments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his paths beyond tracing out! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28229">34</sup> “Who has known the mind of the Lord? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who has been his counselor?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28229j" title="See footnote j">j</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28230">35</sup> “Who has ever given to God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that God should repay him?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28230k" title="See footnote k">k</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28231">36</sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him be the glory forever! Amen. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28198a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28198" title="Go to Romans 11:3">Romans 11:3</a> 1 Kings 19:10,14</li>
