<h4>2 Samuel 3</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8083">1</sup> The war
between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long
time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul
grew weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8084">2</sup> Sons
were born to David in Hebron:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of
Jezreel;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8085">3</sup> his
second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of
Talmai king of Geshur;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8086">4</sup> the
fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8087">5</sup> and the
sixth, Ithream the son of David’s wife Eglah.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were born to David in Hebron.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Abner Goes Over to David</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8088">6</sup> During the
war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had
been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8089">7</sup> Now Saul had had
a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to
Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8090">8</sup> Abner
was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered,
“Am I a dog’s head—on Judah’s side? This very day I am loyal to the
house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven’t
handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense
involving this woman! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8091">9</sup> May God deal with Abner, be it ever so
severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on
oath <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8092">10</sup> and
transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David’s
throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8093">11</sup> Ish-Bosheth did not dare
to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8094">12</sup> Then
Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “Whose land is
it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel
over to you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8095">13</sup>
“Good,” said David. “I will make an agreement with you. But I
demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you
bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8096">14</sup> Then David sent messengers
to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, “Give me my wife Michal,
whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine
foreskins.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8097">15</sup> So
Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband
Paltiel son of Laish. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8098">16</sup> Her husband, however, went with her,
weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him,
“Go back home!” So he went back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8099">17</sup> Abner
conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “For some time you
have wanted to make David your king. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8100">18</sup> Now do it! For the LORD promised David,
‘By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand
of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8101">19</sup> Abner
also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to
tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin
wanted to do. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8102">20</sup>
When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron,
David prepared a feast for him and his men. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-8103">21</sup> Then Abner said to David, “Let me go
at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they
may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that
your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in
peace.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joab Murders Abner</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8104">22</sup> Just then
David’s men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a
great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in
Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8105">23</sup> When Joab and
all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of
Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and
that he had gone in peace.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8106">24</sup> So
Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner
came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8107">25</sup> You know Abner son of Ner;
he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out
everything you are doing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8108">26</sup> Joab
then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought
him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8109">27</sup> Now when Abner
returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though
to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his
brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8110">28</sup> Later,
when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever
innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8111">29</sup> May his blood
fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father’s house! May
Joab’s house never be without someone who has a running sore or
leprosy<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-8111a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> or who leans on a crutch or who
falls by the sword or who lacks food.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8112">30</sup> (Joab
and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their
brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8113">31</sup> Then
David said to Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes
and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner.” King
David himself walked behind the bier. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8114">32</sup> They buried Abner in Hebron, and the
king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb. All the people wept also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8115">33</sup> The
king sang this lament for Abner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Should Abner have died as the lawless
die?<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8116">34</sup> Your
hands were not bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feet were not fettered.<br>
You fell as one falls before wicked men.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the people wept over him again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8117">35</sup> Then
they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still
day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God deal with me, be it
ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun
sets!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8118">36</sup> All
the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king
did pleased them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8119">37</sup> So on that day all the people and all
Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of
Ner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-8120">38</sup> Then
the king said to his men, “Do you not realize that a prince and a
great man has fallen in Israel this day? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-8121">39</sup> And today, though I am the anointed
king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me.
May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!”</p>
