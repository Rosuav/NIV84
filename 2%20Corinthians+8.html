<h4>2 Corinthians 8</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Generosity Encouraged</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28918">1</sup> And now,
brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given
the Macedonian churches. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28919">2</sup> Out of the most severe trial, their
overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich
generosity. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28920">3</sup> For
I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond
their ability. Entirely on their own, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28921">4</sup> they urgently pleaded with us for the
privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28922">5</sup> And they did not do as we
expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us
in keeping with God’s will. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28923">6</sup> So we urged Titus, since he had earlier
made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on
your part. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28924">7</sup> But
just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge,
in complete earnestness and in your love for us<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28924a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>—see that you also excel in this
grace of giving.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28925">8</sup> I am
not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love
by comparing it with the earnestness of others. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28926">9</sup> For you know the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes
he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become
rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28927">10</sup> And
here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last
year you were the first not only to give but also to have the
desire to do so. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28928">11</sup> Now finish the work, so that your eager
willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it,
according to your means. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28929">12</sup> For if the willingness is there, the
gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what
he does not have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28930">13</sup> Our
desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard
pressed, but that there might be equality. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28931">14</sup> At the present time your plenty will
supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply
what you need. Then there will be equality, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28932">15</sup> as it is written: “He who gathered
much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have
too little.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28932b"
title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Titus Sent to Corinth</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28933">16</sup> I thank
God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for
you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28934">17</sup> For Titus
not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much
enthusiasm and on his own initiative. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28935">18</sup> And we are sending along with him the
brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the
gospel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28936">19</sup> What
is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry
the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord
himself and to show our eagerness to help. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-28937">20</sup> We want to avoid any criticism of
the way we administer this liberal gift. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28938">21</sup> For we are taking pains to do what is
right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of
men.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28939">22</sup> In
addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved
to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because
of his great confidence in you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-28940">23</sup> As for Titus, he is my partner and
fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are
representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28941">24</sup> Therefore show these men
the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that
the churches can see it.</p>
