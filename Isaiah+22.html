<h5 class="passage-header">A Prophecy About Jerusalem</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18054">1</sup> An oracle
concerning the Valley of Vision:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What troubles you now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you have all gone up on the roofs,<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18055">2</sup> O town full of
commotion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O city of tumult and revelry?<br>
Your slain were not killed by the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did they die in battle.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18056">3</sup> All your
leaders have fled together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have been captured without using the
bow.<br>
All you who were caught were taken prisoner together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having fled while the enemy was still far
away.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18057">4</sup> Therefore I
said, “Turn away from me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me weep bitterly.<br>
Do not try to console me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the destruction of my people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18058">5</sup> The
Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of tumult and trampling and terror<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Valley of Vision,<br>
a day of battering down walls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of crying out to the mountains.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18059">6</sup> Elam takes up
the quiver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with her charioteers and horses;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kir uncovers the shield.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18060">7</sup> Your choicest
valleys are full of chariots,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and horsemen are posted at the city gates;<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18061">8</sup> the
defenses of Judah are stripped away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you looked in that day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest;<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18062">9</sup> you saw that
the City of David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had many breaches in its defenses;<br>
you stored up water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Lower Pool.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18063">10</sup> You counted
the buildings in Jerusalem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18064">11</sup> You built a
reservoir between the two walls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the water of the Old Pool,<br>
but you did not look to the One who made it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or have regard for the One who planned it long
ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18065">12</sup> The
Lord, the LORD Almighty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called you on that day<br>
to weep and to wail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18066">13</sup> But see, there
is joy and revelry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eating of meat and drinking of wine!<br>
“Let us eat and drink,” you say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“for tomorrow we die!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18067">14</sup> The
LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: “Till your dying day
this sin will not be atoned for,” says the Lord, the LORD
Almighty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18068">15</sup> This
is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go, say to this steward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace:<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18069">16</sup> What are you
doing here and who gave you permission<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cut out a grave for yourself here,<br>
hewing your grave on the height<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and chiseling your resting place in the rock?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18070">17</sup>
“Beware, the LORD is about to take firm hold of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hurl you away, O you mighty man.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18071">18</sup> He will roll
you up tightly like a ball<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and throw you into a large country.<br>
There you will die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there your splendid chariots will remain—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you disgrace to your master’s house!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18072">19</sup> I will depose
you from your office,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will be ousted from your position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18073">20</sup> “In
that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18074">21</sup> I will clothe
him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your
authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in
Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18075">22</sup> I will place on his shoulder the key to
the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he
shuts no one can open. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18076">23</sup> I will drive him like a peg into a firm
place; he will be a seat<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-18076a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of
honor for the house of his father. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-18077">24</sup> All the glory of his family will hang
on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from
the bowls to all the jars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18078">25</sup> “In
that day,” declares the LORD Almighty, “the peg driven into the
firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and
the load hanging on it will be cut down.” The LORD has spoken.</p>
