<h4>Leviticus 16</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Day of Atonement</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3203">1</sup> The LORD
spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died
when they approached the LORD. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3204">2</sup> The LORD said to Moses: “Tell your
brother Aaron not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy
Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the
ark, or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud over the
atonement cover.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3205">3</sup> “This
is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary area: with a young bull for
a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3206">4</sup> He is to put on the sacred
linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to
tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These
are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he
puts them on. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3207">5</sup>
From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin
offering and a ram for a burnt offering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3208">6</sup> “Aaron
is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for
himself and his household. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3209">7</sup> Then he is to take the two goats and
present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3210">8</sup> He is
to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the LORD and the other
for the scapegoat.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-3210a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3211">9</sup> Aaron shall
bring the goat whose lot falls to the LORD and sacrifice it for a
sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3212">10</sup>
But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented
alive before the LORD to be used for making atonement by sending it
into the desert as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3213">11</sup> “Aaron
shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for
himself and his household, and he is to slaughter the bull for his
own sin offering. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3214">12</sup> He is to take a censer full of burning
coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely
ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3215">13</sup> He is to put
the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the smoke of the
incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so
that he will not die. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3216">14</sup> He is to take some of the bull’s blood
and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement
cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven
times before the atonement cover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3217">15</sup> “He
shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people
and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with
the bull’s blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and
in front of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3218">16</sup>
In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because
of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their
sins have been. He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting, which
is among them in the midst of their uncleanness. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3219">17</sup> No one is to be in the
Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in
the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for
himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3220">18</sup> “Then
he shall come out to the altar that is before the LORD and make
atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull’s blood and some
of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3221">19</sup> He shall
sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to
cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the
Israelites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3222">20</sup> “When
Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the
Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live
goat. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3223">21</sup> He is to
lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all
the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and
put them on the goat’s head. He shall send the goat away into the
desert in the care of a man appointed for the task. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3224">22</sup> The goat will carry on
itself all their sins to a solitary place; and the man shall
release it in the desert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3225">23</sup> “Then
Aaron is to go into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen
garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is
to leave them there. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3226">24</sup> He shall bathe himself with water in a
holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out
and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering
for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3227">25</sup> He shall also
burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3228">26</sup> “The
man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and
bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3229">27</sup> The bull and
the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the
Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp;
their hides, flesh and offal are to be burned up. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3230">28</sup> The man who burns them
must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he
may come into the camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3231">29</sup> “This
is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the
seventh month you must deny yourselves<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-3231b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> and not do any work—whether
native-born or an alien living among you— <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3232">30</sup> because on this day atonement will be
made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the LORD, you will be
clean from all your sins. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3233">31</sup> It is a sabbath of rest, and you must
deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-3234">32</sup> The priest who is anointed and
ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement.
He is to put on the sacred linen garments <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-3235">33</sup> and make atonement for the Most Holy
Place, for the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and for the priests
and all the people of the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-3236">34</sup> “This
is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once
a year for all the sins of the Israelites.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was done, as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
