<h4>Revelation 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Scroll and the Lamb</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30765">1</sup> Then I
saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with
writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30766">2</sup> And I saw a mighty angel
proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and
open the scroll?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30767">3</sup> But no one in heaven or on earth or
under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30768">4</sup> I wept and wept
because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look
inside. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30769">5</sup> Then
one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to
open the scroll and its seven seals.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30770">6</sup> Then I
saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the center
of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the
elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven
spirits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30770a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of God sent out into all the
earth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30771">7</sup> He came
and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the
throne. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30772">8</sup> And
when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four
elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were
holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the
saints. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30773">9</sup> And
they sang a new song:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are worthy to take the scroll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to open its seals,<br>
because you were slain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with your blood you purchased men for God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from every tribe and language and people and
nation.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30774">10</sup> You have made
them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will reign on the earth.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30775">11</sup> Then
I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands
upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled
the throne and the living creatures and the elders. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30776">12</sup> In a loud voice they
sang:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,<br>
to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength<br>
and honor and glory and praise!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30777">13</sup> Then
I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth
and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To him who sits on the throne and to the
Lamb<br>
be praise and honor and glory and power,<br>
for ever and ever!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30778">14</sup> The
four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and
worshiped.</p>
