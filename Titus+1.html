<h4>Titus 1</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29878">1</sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God’s elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29879">2</sup> a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29880">3</sup> and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29881">4</sup> To Titus, my true son in our common faith: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. <h5 class="passage-header">Titus’s Task on Crete</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29882">5</sup> The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29882a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> elders in every town, as I directed you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29883">6</sup> An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29884">7</sup> Since an overseer<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29884b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> is entrusted with God’s work, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29885">8</sup> Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29886">9</sup> He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29887">10</sup> For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29888">11</sup> They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29889">12</sup> Even one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29890">13</sup> This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29891">14</sup> and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29892">15</sup> To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29893">16</sup> They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29882a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29882" title="Ir a Titus 1:5">Titus 1:5</a> Or <i>ordain</i></li>
