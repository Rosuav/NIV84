<h4>Jeremiah 8</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19155">1</sup> “‘At
that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings and officials
of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of
the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19156">2</sup> They will be
exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens,
which they have loved and served and which they have followed and
consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried,
but will be like refuse lying on the ground. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-19157">3</sup> Wherever I banish them, all the
survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares
the LORD Almighty.’</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Sin and Punishment</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19158">4</sup> “Say to
them, ‘This is what the LORD says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘When men fall down, do they not get up?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a man turns away, does he not return?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19159">5</sup> Why then have
these people turned away?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does Jerusalem always turn away?<br>
They cling to deceit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they refuse to return.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19160">6</sup> I have listened
attentively,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they do not say what is right.<br>
No one repents of his wickedness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, “What have I done?”<br>
Each pursues his own course<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a horse charging into battle.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19161">7</sup> Even the stork
in the sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knows her appointed seasons,<br>
and the dove, the swift and the thrush<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observe the time of their migration.<br>
But my people do not know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the requirements of the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19162">8</sup> “‘How
can you say, “We are wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for we have the law of the LORD,”<br>
when actually the lying pen of the scribes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has handled it falsely?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19163">9</sup> The wise will
be put to shame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be dismayed and trapped.<br>
Since they have rejected the word of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what kind of wisdom do they have?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19164">10</sup> Therefore I
will give their wives to other men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their fields to new owners.<br>
From the least to the greatest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all are greedy for gain;<br>
prophets and priests alike,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all practice deceit.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19165">11</sup> They dress the
wound of my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as though it were not serious.<br>
“Peace, peace,” they say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when there is no peace.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19166">12</sup> Are they
ashamed of their loathsome conduct?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they have no shame at all;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not even know how to blush.<br>
So they will fall among the fallen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be brought down when they are
punished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19167">13</sup> “‘I
will take away their harvest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no grapes on the vine.<br>
There will be no figs on the tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their leaves will wither.<br>
What I have given them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be taken from them.<sup class=

<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19168">14</sup> “Why
are we sitting here?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather together!<br>
Let us flee to the fortified cities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perish there!<br>
For the LORD our God has doomed us to perish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and given us poisoned water to drink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because we have sinned against him.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19169">15</sup> We hoped for
peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no good has come,<br>
for a time of healing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there was only terror.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19170">16</sup> The snorting
of the enemy’s horses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is heard from Dan;<br>
at the neighing of their stallions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole land trembles.<br>
They have come to devour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land and everything in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city and all who live there.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19171">17</sup> “See,
I will send venomous snakes among you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vipers that cannot be charmed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will bite you,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares
the LORD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19172">18</sup> O my
Comforter<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-19172b"
title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart is faint within me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19173">19</sup> Listen to the
cry of my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from a land far away:<br>
“Is the LORD not in Zion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is her King no longer there?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why have they provoked me to anger with their
images,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their worthless foreign idols?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19174">20</sup> “The
harvest is past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the summer has ended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we are not saved.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19175">21</sup> Since
my people are crushed, I am crushed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mourn, and horror grips me.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19176">22</sup> Is there no
balm in Gilead?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no physician there?<br>
Why then is there no healing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the wound of my people?</p>
