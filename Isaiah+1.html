Listen, O earth! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the LORD has spoken: <br />“I reared children and brought them up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they have rebelled against me. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17658">3</sup> The ox knows his master, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the donkey his owner’s manger, <br />but Israel does not know, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my people do not understand.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17659">4</sup> Ah, sinful nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a people loaded with guilt, <br />a brood of evildoers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children given to corruption! <br />They have forsaken the LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have spurned the Holy One of Israel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turned their backs on him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17660">5</sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you persist in rebellion? <br />Your whole head is injured, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your whole heart afflicted. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17661">6</sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no soundness— <br />only wounds and welts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and open sores, <br />not cleansed or bandaged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or soothed with oil. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17662">7</sup> Your country is desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your cities burned with fire; <br />your fields are being stripped by foreigners <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right before you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17663">8</sup> The Daughter of Zion is left <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a shelter in a vineyard, <br />like a hut in a field of melons, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a city under siege. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17664">9</sup> Unless the LORD Almighty <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had left us some survivors, <br />we would have become like Sodom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would have been like Gomorrah. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17665">10</sup> Hear the word of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you rulers of Sodom; <br />listen to the law of our God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you people of Gomorrah! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17666">11</sup> “The multitude of your sacrifices— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what are they to me?” says the LORD. <br />“I have more than enough of burnt offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of rams and the fat of fattened animals; <br />I have no pleasure <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17667">12</sup> When you come to appear before me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has asked this of you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this trampling of my courts? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17668">13</sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your incense is detestable to me. <br />New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17669">14</sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my soul hates. <br />They have become a burden to me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am weary of bearing them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17670">15</sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will hide my eyes from you; <br />even if you offer many prayers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not listen. <br />Your hands are full of blood; <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17671">16</sup> wash and make yourselves clean. <br />Take your evil deeds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of my sight! <br />Stop doing wrong, <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17672">17</sup> learn to do right! <br />Seek justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourage the oppressed.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-17672a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <br />Defend the cause of the fatherless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plead the case of the widow. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17673">18</sup> “Come now, let us reason together,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. <br />“Though your sins are like scarlet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be as white as snow; <br />though they are red as crimson, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be like wool. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17674">19</sup> If you are willing and obedient, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will eat the best from the land; <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17675">20</sup> but if you resist and rebel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be devoured by the sword.” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17676">21</sup> See how the faithful city <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become a harlot! <br />She once was full of justice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness used to dwell in her— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now murderers! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17677">22</sup> Your silver has become dross, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your choice wine is diluted with water. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17678">23</sup> Your rulers are rebels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companions of thieves; <br />they all love bribes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and chase after gifts. <br />They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the widow’s case does not come before them. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17679">24</sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Mighty One of Israel, declares: <br />“Ah, I will get relief from my foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and avenge myself on my enemies. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17680">25</sup> I will turn my hand against you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will thoroughly purge away your dross <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and remove all your impurities. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17681">26</sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your counselors as at the beginning. <br />Afterward you will be called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the City of Righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Faithful City.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17682">27</sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her penitent ones with righteousness. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17683">28</sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17684">29</sup> “You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which you have delighted; <br />you will be disgraced because of the gardens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you have chosen. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17685">30</sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a garden without water. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-17686">31</sup> The mighty man will become tinder <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his work a spark; <br />both will burn together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one to quench the fire.” <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-17672a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-17672" title="Ir a Isaiah 1:17">Isaiah 1:17</a> Or <i>/ rebuke the oppressor</i></li>
