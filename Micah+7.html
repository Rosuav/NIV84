<p><h4>Micah 7</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Israel’s Misery</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22666">1</sup> What misery is mine! <br />I am like one who gathers summer fruit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the gleaning of the vineyard; <br />there is no cluster of grapes to eat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none of the early figs that I crave. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22667">2</sup> The godly have been swept from the land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one upright man remains. <br />All men lie in wait to shed blood; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each hunts his brother with a net. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22668">3</sup> Both hands are skilled in doing evil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruler demands gifts, <br />the judge accepts bribes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the powerful dictate what they desire— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they all conspire together. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22669">4</sup> The best of them is like a brier, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. <br />The day of your watchmen has come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day God visits you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time of their confusion. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22670">5</sup> Do not trust a neighbor; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put no confidence in a friend. <br />Even with her who lies in your embrace <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be careful of your words. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22671">6</sup> For a son dishonors his father, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a daughter rises up against her mother, <br />a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man’s enemies are the members of his own household. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22672">7</sup> But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for God my Savior; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God will hear me. <h5 class="passage-header">Israel Will Rise</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22673">8</sup> Do not gloat over me, my enemy! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I have fallen, I will rise. <br />Though I sit in darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will be my light. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22674">9</sup> Because I have sinned against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bear the LORD’s wrath, <br />until he pleads my case <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and establishes my right. <br />He will bring me out into the light; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will see his righteousness. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22675">10</sup> Then my enemy will see it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will be covered with shame, <br />she who said to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where is the LORD your God?” <br />My eyes will see her downfall; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even now she will be trampled underfoot <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like mire in the streets. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22676">11</sup> The day for building your walls will come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day for extending your boundaries. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22677">12</sup> In that day people will come to you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, <br />even from Egypt to the Euphrates <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from sea to sea <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from mountain to mountain. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22678">13</sup> The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the result of their deeds. <h5 class="passage-header">Prayer and Praise</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22679">14</sup> Shepherd your people with your staff, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flock of your inheritance, <br />which lives by itself in a forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in fertile pasturelands.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22679a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in days long ago. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22680">15</sup> “As in the days when you came out of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will show them my wonders.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22681">16</sup> Nations will see and be ashamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deprived of all their power. <br />They will lay their hands on their mouths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their ears will become deaf. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22682">17</sup> They will lick dust like a snake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like creatures that crawl on the ground. <br />They will come trembling out of their dens; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will turn in fear to the LORD our God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will be afraid of you. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22683">18</sup> Who is a God like you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who pardons sin and forgives the transgression <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the remnant of his inheritance? <br />You do not stay angry forever <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but delight to show mercy. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22684">19</sup> You will again have compassion on us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will tread our sins underfoot <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22685">20</sup> You will be true to Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and show mercy to Abraham, <br />as you pledged on oath to our fathers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in days long ago. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22679a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22679" title="Go to Micah 7:14">Micah 7:14</a> Or <i>in the middle of Carmel</i></li>
