<p><h4>Jeremiah 2</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Israel Forsakes God</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18967">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18968">2</sup> “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I remember the devotion of your youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how as a bride you loved me <br />and followed me through the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through a land not sown. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18969">3</sup> Israel was holy to the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firstfruits of his harvest; <br />all who devoured her were held guilty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disaster overtook them,’” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18970">4</sup> Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all you clans of the house of Israel. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18971">5</sup> This is what the LORD says: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What fault did your fathers find in me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they strayed so far from me? <br />They followed worthless idols <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and became worthless themselves. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18972">6</sup> They did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who brought us up out of Egypt <br />and led us through the barren wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through a land of deserts and rifts, <br />a land of drought and darkness,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18972a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a land where no one travels and no one lives?’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18973">7</sup> I brought you into a fertile land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to eat its fruit and rich produce. <br />But you came and defiled my land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made my inheritance detestable. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18974">8</sup> The priests did not ask, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Where is the LORD?’ <br />Those who deal with the law did not know me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the leaders rebelled against me. <br />The prophets prophesied by Baal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following worthless idols. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18975">9</sup> “Therefore I bring charges against you again,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And I will bring charges against your children’s children. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18976">10</sup> Cross over to the coasts of Kittim<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18976b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and look, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send to Kedar<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18976c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and observe closely; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see if there has ever been anything like this: <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18977">11</sup> Has a nation ever changed its gods?

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then has he become plunder? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18981">15</sup> Lions have roared; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have growled at him. <br />They have laid waste his land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his towns are burned and deserted. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18982">16</sup> Also, the men of Memphis<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18982e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> and Tahpanhes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have shaved the crown of your head.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18982f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18983">17</sup> Have you not brought this on yourselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by forsaking the LORD your God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he led you in the way? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18984">18</sup> Now why go to Egypt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to drink water from the Shihor<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18984g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>? <br />And why go to Assyria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to drink water from the River<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-18984h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup>? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18985">19</sup> Your wickedness will punish you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your backsliding will rebuke you. <br />Consider then and realize <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how evil and bitter it is for you <br />when you forsake the LORD your God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have no awe of me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18986">20</sup> “Long ago you broke off your yoke <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tore off your bonds; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you said, ‘I will not serve you!’ <br />Indeed, on every high hill <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under every spreading tree <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you lay down as a prostitute. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18987">21</sup> I had planted you like a choice vine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sound and reliable stock. <br />How then did you turn against me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into a corrupt, wild vine? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18988">22</sup> Although you wash yourself with soda <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and use an abundance of soap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stain of your guilt is still before me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Sovereign LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18989">23</sup> “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not run after the Baals’? <br />See how you behaved in the valley; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider what you have done. <br />You are a swift she-camel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;running here and there, <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18990">24</sup> a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sniffing the wind in her craving— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her heat who can restrain her? <br />Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at mating time they will find her. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18991">25</sup> Do not run until your feet are bare <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your throat is dry. <br />But you said, ‘It’s no use! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love foreign gods, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I must go after them.’ <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18992">26</sup> “As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the house of Israel is disgraced— <br />they, their kings and their officials, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their priests and their prophets. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18993">27</sup> They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ <br />They have turned their backs to me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not their faces; <br />yet when they are in trouble, they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Come and save us!’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18994">28</sup> Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them come if they can save you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you are in trouble! <br />For you have as many gods <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you have towns, O Judah. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18995">29</sup> “Why do you bring charges against me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have all rebelled against me,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18996">30</sup> “In vain I punished your people; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they did not respond to correction. <br />Your sword has devoured your prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a ravening lion. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18997">31</sup> “You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have I been a desert to Israel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a land of great darkness? <br />Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will come to you no more’? <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18998">32</sup> Does a maiden forget her jewelry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bride her wedding ornaments? <br />Yet my people have forgotten me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days without number. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-18999">33</sup> How skilled you are at pursuing love! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the worst of women can learn from your ways. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19000">34</sup> On your clothes men find <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lifeblood of the innocent poor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though you did not catch them breaking in. <br />Yet in spite of all this <br />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19001">35</sup> you say, ‘I am innocent; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is not angry with me.’ <br />But I will pass judgment on you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’ <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19002">36</sup> Why do you go about so much, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changing your ways? <br />You will be disappointed by Egypt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you were by Assyria. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-19003">37</sup> You will also leave that place <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your hands on your head, <br />for the LORD has rejected those you trust; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will not be helped by them. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-18972a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-18972" title="Go to Jeremiah 2:6">Jeremiah 2:6</a> Or <i>and the shadow of death</i></li>
