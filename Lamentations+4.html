<p><h4>Lamentations 4</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20422">1</sup> <sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20422a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>How the gold has lost its luster, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fine gold become dull! <br />The sacred gems are scattered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of every street. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20423">2</sup> How the precious sons of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once worth their weight in gold, <br />are now considered as pots of clay, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of a potter’s hands! <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20424">3</sup> Even jackals offer their breasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to nurse their young, <br />but my people have become heartless <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like ostriches in the desert. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20425">4</sup> Because of thirst the infant’s tongue <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sticks to the roof of its mouth; <br />the children beg for bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no one gives it to them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20426">5</sup> Those who once ate delicacies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are destitute in the streets. <br />Those nurtured in purple <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now lie on ash heaps. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20427">6</sup> The punishment of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is greater than that of Sodom, <br />which was overthrown in a moment <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without a hand turned to help her. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20428">7</sup> Their princes were brighter than snow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whiter than milk, <br />their bodies more ruddy than rubies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their appearance like sapphires.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20428b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20429">8</sup> But now they are blacker than soot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are not recognized in the streets. <br />Their skin has shriveled on their bones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has become as dry as a stick. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20430">9</sup> Those killed by the sword are better off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those who die of famine; <br />racked with hunger, they waste away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for lack of food from the field. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20431">10</sup> With their own hands compassionate women <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have cooked their own children, <br />who became their food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when my people were destroyed. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20432">11</sup> The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has poured out his fierce anger. <br />He kindled a fire in Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that consumed her foundations. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20433">12</sup> The kings of the earth did not believe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did any of the world’s people, <br />that enemies and foes could enter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gates of Jerusalem. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20434">13</sup> But it happened because of the sins of her prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the iniquities of her priests, <br />who shed within her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blood of the righteous. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20435">14</sup> Now they grope through the streets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like men who are blind. <br />They are so defiled with blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that no one dares to touch their garments. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20436">15</sup> “Go away! You are unclean!” men cry to them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Away! Away! Don’t touch us!” <br />When they flee and wander about, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people among the nations say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They can stay here no longer.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20437">16</sup> The LORD himself has scattered them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he no longer watches over them. <br />The priests are shown no honor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elders no favor. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20438">17</sup> Moreover, our eyes failed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking in vain for help; <br />from our towers we watched <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a nation that could not save us. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20439">18</sup> Men stalked us at every step, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we could not walk in our streets. <br />Our end was near, our days were numbered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for our end had come. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20440">19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than eagles in the sky; <br />they chased us over the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay in wait for us in the desert. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20441">20</sup> The LORD’s anointed, our very life breath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was caught in their traps. <br />We thought that under his shadow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would live among the nations. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20442">21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in the land of Uz. <br />But to you also the cup will be passed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be drunk and stripped naked. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20443">22</sup> O Daughter of Zion, your punishment will end; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not prolong your exile. <br />But, O Daughter of Edom, he will punish your sin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and expose your wickedness. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20422a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20422" title="Go to Lamentations 4:1">Lamentations 4:1</a> This chapter is an acrostic poem, the verses of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</li>
