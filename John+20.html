<h4>John 20</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Empty Tomb</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26858">1</sup> Early on
the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the
entrance. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26859">2</sup> So
she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one
Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,
and we don’t know where they have put him!”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26860">3</sup> So
Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26861">4</sup> Both were running, but the
other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26862">5</sup> He bent over and looked in
at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26863">6</sup> Then Simon Peter, who was
behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of
linen lying there, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26864">7</sup> as well as the burial cloth that had
been around Jesus’ head. The cloth was folded up by itself,
separate from the linen. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26865">8</sup> Finally the other disciple, who had
reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26866">9</sup> (They still did
not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the
dead.)</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26867">10</sup> Then the
disciples went back to their homes, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26868">11</sup> but Mary stood outside the tomb crying.
As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26869">12</sup> and saw two angels in
white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the
other at the foot.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26870">13</sup> They
asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and
I don’t know where they have put him.” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26871">14</sup> At this, she turned around and saw
Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was
Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26872">15</sup> “Woman,”</font> he said, <font class=
'woj'>“why are you crying? Who is it you are looking
for?”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir,
if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I
will get him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26873">16</sup> Jesus
said to her, <font class='woj'>“Mary.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned toward him and cried out in
Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26874">17</sup> Jesus
said, <font class='woj'>“Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet
returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I
am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God.’”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26875">18</sup> Mary
Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the
Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26876">19</sup> On the
evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were
together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came
and stood among them and said, <font class='woj'>“Peace be with
you!”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26877">20</sup>
After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The
disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26878">21</sup> Again
Jesus said, <font class='woj'>“Peace be with you! As the Father has
sent me, I am sending you.”</font> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26879">22</sup> And with that he breathed on them and
said, <font class='woj'>“Receive the Holy Spirit.</font>
<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26880">23</sup> If you forgive anyone his sins, they
are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not
forgiven.”</font></p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Jesus Appears to Thomas</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26881">24</sup> Now
Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the
disciples when Jesus came. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26882">25</sup> So the other disciples told him, “We
have seen the Lord!”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail
marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put
my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26883">26</sup> A
week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was
with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among
them and said, <font class='woj'>“Peace be with you!”</font>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26884">27</sup> Then he said
to Thomas, <font class='woj'>“Put your finger here; see my hands.
Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and
believe.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26885">28</sup>
Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26886">29</sup> Then
Jesus told him, <font class='woj'>“Because you have seen me, you
have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have
believed.”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-26887">30</sup> Jesus
did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples,
which are not recorded in this book. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-26888">31</sup> But these are written that you
may<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-26888a" title=
"See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his
name.</p>
