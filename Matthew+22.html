<p><h4>Matthew 22</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Parable of the Wedding Banquet</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23872">1</sup> Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23873">2</sup> “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23874">3</sup> He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23875">4</sup> “Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23876">5</sup> “But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23877">6</sup> The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23878">7</sup> The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23879">8</sup> “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23880">9</sup> Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23881">10</sup> So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23882">11</sup> “But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23883">12</sup> ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless.</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23884">13</sup> “Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23885">14</sup> “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Paying Taxes to Caesar</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23886">15</sup> Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23887">16</sup> They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23888">17</sup> Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23889">18</sup> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, <font class='woj'>“You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23890">19</sup> Show me the coin used for paying the tax.”</font> They brought him a denarius, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23891">20</sup> and he asked them, <font class='woj'>“Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23892">21</sup> “Caesar’s,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to them, <font class='woj'>“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23893">22</sup> When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. <h5 class="passage-header">Marriage at the Resurrection</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23894">23</sup> That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23895">24</sup> “Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23896">25</sup> Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23897">26</sup> The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23898">27</sup> Finally, the woman died. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23899">28</sup> Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23900">29</sup> Jesus replied, <font class='woj'>“You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23901">30</sup> At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23902">31</sup> But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you,</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23903">32</sup> ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23903a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”</font> <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23904">33</sup> When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. <h5 class="passage-header">The Greatest Commandment</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23905">34</sup> Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23906">35</sup> One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23907">36</sup> “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23908">37</sup> Jesus replied: <font class='woj'>“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23908b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23909">38</sup> This is the first and greatest commandment.</font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23910">39</sup> And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23910c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></font> <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23911">40</sup> All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</font> <h5 class="passage-header">Whose Son Is the Christ?</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23912">41</sup> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, <font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23913">42</sup> “What do you think about the Christ<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23913d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>? Whose son is he?”</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The son of David,” they replied. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23914">43</sup> He said to them, <font class='woj'>“How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,</font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23915">44</sup> “‘The Lord said to my Lord:</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>“Sit at my right hand</font> <br /><font class='woj'>until I put your enemies</font> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'>under your feet.”’<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-23915e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup></font> <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj'><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23916">45</sup> If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</font> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-23917">46</sup> No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-23903a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-23903" title="Go to Matthew 22:32">Matthew 22:32</a> Exodus 3:6</li>
