<h4>Exodus 27</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">The Altar of Burnt Offering</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2274">1</sup> “Build an
altar of acacia wood, three cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2274a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> high;
it is to be square, five cubits long and five cubits
wide.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2274b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2275">2</sup> Make a horn at each of the four corners,
so that the horns and the altar are of one piece, and overlay the
altar with bronze. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2276">3</sup> Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots
to remove the ashes, and its shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks
and firepans. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2277">4</sup>
Make a grating for it, a bronze network, and make a bronze ring at
each of the four corners of the network. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2278">5</sup> Put it under the ledge of the altar so
that it is halfway up the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2279">6</sup> Make poles of acacia wood for the altar
and overlay them with bronze. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2280">7</sup> The poles are to be inserted into the
rings so they will be on two sides of the altar when it is carried.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2281">8</sup> Make the altar
hollow, out of boards. It is to be made just as you were shown on
the mountain.
<h5 class="passage-header">The Courtyard</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2282">9</sup> “Make a
courtyard for the tabernacle. The south side shall be a hundred

bases and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <sup class=

"Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> long are to be on one side of the
entrance, with three posts and three bases, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2288">15</sup> and curtains fifteen cubits long are
to be on the other side, with three posts and three bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2289">16</sup> “For
the entrance to the courtyard, provide a curtain twenty
cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2289f" title=
"Vea nota al pie f">f</a>]</sup> long, of blue, purple and scarlet
yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer—with four
posts and four bases. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2290">17</sup> All the posts around the courtyard are
to have silver bands and hooks, and bronze bases. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2291">18</sup> The courtyard shall be a
hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide,<sup class=

linen five cubits<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2291h" title="Vea nota al pie h">h</a>]</sup> high,
and with bronze bases. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2292">19</sup> All the other articles used in the
service of the tabernacle, whatever their function, including all
the tent pegs for it and those for the courtyard, are to be of
bronze.</p>
<h5 class="passage-header">Oil for the Lampstand</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2293">20</sup> “Command
the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the
light so that the lamps may be kept burning. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2294">21</sup> In the Tent of Meeting, outside the
curtain that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are
to keep the lamps burning before the LORD from evening till
morning. This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for
the generations to come.
