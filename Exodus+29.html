<h5 class="passage-header">Consecration of the Priests</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2338">1</sup> “This is
what you are to do to consecrate them, so they may serve me as
priests: Take a young bull and two rams without defect. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2339">2</sup> And from fine wheat flour,
without yeast, make bread, and cakes mixed with oil, and wafers
spread with oil. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2340">3</sup>
Put them in a basket and present them in it—along with the bull and
the two rams. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2341">4</sup>
Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting and wash them with water. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2342">5</sup> Take the garments and dress Aaron with
the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself and the
breastpiece. Fasten the ephod on him by its skillfully woven
waistband. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2343">6</sup> Put
the turban on his head and attach the sacred diadem to the turban.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2344">7</sup> Take the
anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2345">8</sup> Bring his sons and dress
them in tunics <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2346">9</sup>
and put headbands on them. Then tie sashes on Aaron and his
sons.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2346a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> The priesthood is theirs by a
lasting ordinance. In this way you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2347">10</sup> “Bring
the bull to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his
sons shall lay their hands on its head. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2348">11</sup> Slaughter it in the LORD’s presence at
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2349">12</sup> Take some of the bull’s blood and put it
on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest
of it at the base of the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2350">13</sup> Then take all the fat around the inner
parts, the covering of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on
them, and burn them on the altar. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2351">14</sup> But burn the bull’s flesh and its hide
and its offal outside the camp. It is a sin offering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2352">15</sup> “Take
one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on
its head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2353">16</sup>
Slaughter it and take the blood and sprinkle it against the altar
on all sides. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2354">17</sup>
Cut the ram into pieces and wash the inner parts and the legs,
putting them with the head and the other pieces. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2355">18</sup> Then burn the entire ram
on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma,
an offering made to the LORD by fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2356">19</sup> “Take
the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its
head. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2357">20</sup> Slaughter
it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right
ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and
on the big toes of their right feet. Then sprinkle blood against
the altar on all sides. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2358">21</sup> And take some of the blood on the altar
and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his
garments and on his sons and their garments. Then he and his sons
and their garments will be consecrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2359">22</sup> “Take
from this ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat around the inner
parts, the covering of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on
them, and the right thigh. (This is the ram for the ordination.)
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2360">23</sup> From the basket
of bread made without yeast, which is before the LORD, take a loaf,
and a cake made with oil, and a wafer. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2361">24</sup> Put all these in the hands of Aaron and
his sons and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2362">25</sup> Then take them
from their hands and burn them on the altar along with the burnt
offering for a pleasing aroma to the LORD, an offering made to the
LORD by fire. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2363">26</sup>
After you take the breast of the ram for Aaron’s ordination, wave
it before the LORD as a wave offering, and it will be your
share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2364">27</sup>
“Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron
and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was
presented. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2365">28</sup> This
is always to be the regular share from the Israelites for Aaron and
his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the
LORD from their fellowship offerings.<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-2365b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2366">29</sup>
“Aaron’s sacred garments will belong to his descendants so that
they can be anointed and ordained in them. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2367">30</sup> The son who succeeds him as priest
and comes to the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place is
to wear them seven days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2368">31</sup> “Take
the ram for the ordination and cook the meat in a sacred place.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2369">32</sup> At the entrance
to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of
the ram and the bread that is in the basket. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-2370">33</sup> They are to eat these offerings by
which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But
no one else may eat them, because they are sacred. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2371">34</sup> And if any of the meat of
the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it
up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2372">35</sup> “Do
for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking
seven days to ordain them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2373">36</sup> Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin
offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement
for it, and anoint it to consecrate it. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2374">37</sup> For seven days make atonement for the
altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and
whatever touches it will be holy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2375">38</sup> “This
is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs
a year old. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2376">39</sup>
Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2377">40</sup> With the first lamb offer
a tenth of an ephah<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2377c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of fine
flour mixed with a quarter of a hin<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-2377d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup> of oil
from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink
offering. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2378">41</sup>
Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering
and its drink offering as in the morning—a pleasing aroma, an
offering made to the LORD by fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2379">42</sup> “For
the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly
at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD. There I
will meet you and speak to you; <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2380">43</sup> there also I will meet with the
Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2381">44</sup> “So I
will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar and will
consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-2382">45</sup> Then I will dwell among
the Israelites and be their God. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-2383">46</sup> They will know that I am the LORD their
God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among
them. I am the LORD their God.</p>
