<h4>Genesis 7</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-161">1</sup> The LORD
then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family,
because I have found you righteous in this generation. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-162">2</sup> Take with you
seven<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-162a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> of every kind of clean animal, a
male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male
and its mate, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-163">3</sup> and
also seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their
various kinds alive throughout the earth. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-164">4</sup> Seven days from now I will send rain on
the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the
face of the earth every living creature I have made.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-165">5</sup> And Noah
did all that the LORD commanded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-166">6</sup> Noah was
six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-167">7</sup> And Noah and his
sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the
waters of the flood. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-168">8</sup> Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of
birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-169">9</sup> male and female, came to
Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-170">10</sup> And after the seven days
the floodwaters came on the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-171">11</sup> In the
six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the
second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst
forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-172">12</sup> And rain fell on the earth
forty days and forty nights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-173">13</sup> On that
very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with
his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-174">14</sup> They had with
them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock
according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the
ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind,
everything with wings. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-175">15</sup> Pairs of all creatures that have the
breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-176">16</sup> The animals
going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had
commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-177">17</sup> For
forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters
increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-178">18</sup> The waters rose and
increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface
of the water. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-179">19</sup>
They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under
the entire heavens were covered. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-180">20</sup> The waters rose and covered the mountains
to a depth of more than twenty feet.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=

<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-181">21</sup> Every living
thing that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, wild
animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all
mankind. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-182">22</sup>
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils
died. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-183">23</sup> Every
living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and
animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds
of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those
with him in the ark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-184">24</sup> The
waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.</p>
