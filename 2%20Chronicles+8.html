<h5 class="passage-header">Solomon’s Other Activities</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11348">1</sup> At the
end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the
LORD and his own palace, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11349">2</sup> Solomon rebuilt the villages that
Hiram<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-11349a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> had given him, and settled
Israelites in them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11350">3</sup> Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and
captured it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11351">4</sup> He
also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had
built in Hamath. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11352">5</sup> He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower
Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11353">6</sup> as well as
Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his
chariots and for his horses<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11353b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup>—whatever he desired to build in
Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11354">7</sup> All
the people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites
and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites), <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11355">8</sup> that is, their descendants
remaining in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed—these
Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this
day. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11356">9</sup> But
Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they
were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders
of his chariots and charioteers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-11357">10</sup> They were also King Solomon’s chief
officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11358">11</sup>
Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the
palace he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in
the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of
the LORD has entered are holy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11359">12</sup> On
the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico,
Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD, <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11360">13</sup> according to the daily
requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for Sabbaths, New
Moons and the three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11361">14</sup> In keeping with the
ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the
priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to
assist the priests according to each day’s requirement. He also
appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates,
because this was what David the man of God had ordered. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11362">15</sup> They did not deviate from
the king’s commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter,
including that of the treasuries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11363">16</sup> All
Solomon’s work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the
temple of the LORD was laid until its completion. So the temple of
the LORD was finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11364">17</sup> Then
Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-11365">18</sup> And Hiram sent
him ships commanded by his own officers, men who knew the sea.
These, with Solomon’s men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four
hundred and fifty talents<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-11365c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> of
gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</p>
