<h4>Genesis 44</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">A Silver Cup in a Sack</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1326">1</sup> Now Joseph
gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the
men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s
silver in the mouth of his sack. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1327">2</sup> Then put my cup, the silver one, in the
mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his
grain.” And he did as Joseph said.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1328">3</sup> As
morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1329">4</sup> They had not
gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after
those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them,
‘Why have you repaid good with evil? <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1330">5</sup> Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from
and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have
done.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1331">6</sup> When he
caught up with them, he repeated these words to them. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1332">7</sup> But they said to him, “Why
does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do
anything like that! <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1333">8</sup> We even brought back to you from the land
of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So
why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1334">9</sup> If any of your
servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will
become my lord’s slaves.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1335">10</sup> “Very
well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to
have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from
blame.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1336">11</sup> Each
of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1337">12</sup> Then the
steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending
with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1338">13</sup> At this, they
tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned
to the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1339">14</sup> Joseph
was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and
they threw themselves to the ground before him. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1340">15</sup> Joseph said to them, “What
is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find
things out by divination?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1341">16</sup> “What
can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we
prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are
now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have
the cup.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1342">17</sup> But
Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man
who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of
you, go back to your father in peace.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1343">18</sup> Then
Judah went up to him and said: “Please, my lord, let your servant
speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though
you are equal to Pharaoh himself. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1344">19</sup> My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have
a father or a brother?’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1345">20</sup> And we answered, ‘We have an aged
father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His
brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left,
and his father loves him.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1346">21</sup> “Then
you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him
for myself.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1347">22</sup>
And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he
leaves him, his father will die.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1348">23</sup> But you told your servants, ‘Unless your
youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face
again.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1349">24</sup> When we
went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had
said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1350">25</sup> “Then
our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’ <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1351">26</sup> But we said, ‘We cannot go
down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot
see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1352">27</sup> “Your
servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two
sons. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1353">28</sup> One of
them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to
pieces.” And I have not seen him since. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1354">29</sup> If you take this one from me too and
harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the
grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1354a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in misery.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1355">30</sup> “So
now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my
father and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the
boy’s life, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1356">31</sup>
sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will
bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1357">32</sup> Your servant
guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not
bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father,
all my life!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1358">33</sup> “Now
then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in
place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1359">34</sup> How can I go
back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see
the misery that would come upon my father.”</p>
