<p><h4>Zephaniah 3</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Future of Jerusalem</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22822">1</sup> Woe to the city of oppressors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebellious and defiled! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22823">2</sup> She obeys no one, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she accepts no correction. <br />She does not trust in the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she does not draw near to her God. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22824">3</sup> Her officials are roaring lions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her rulers are evening wolves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who leave nothing for the morning. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22825">4</sup> Her prophets are arrogant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are treacherous men. <br />Her priests profane the sanctuary <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do violence to the law. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22826">5</sup> The LORD within her is righteous; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does no wrong. <br />Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every new day he does not fail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet the unrighteous know no shame. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22827">6</sup> “I have cut off nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their strongholds are demolished. <br />I have left their streets deserted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one passing through. <br />Their cities are destroyed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one will be left—no one at all. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22828">7</sup> I said to the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Surely you will fear me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and accept correction!’ <br />Then her dwelling would not be cut off, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor all my punishments come upon her. <br />But they were still eager <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to act corruptly in all they did. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22829">8</sup> Therefore wait for me,” declares the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“for the day I will stand up to testify.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22829a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> <br />I have decided to assemble the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to gather the kingdoms <br />and to pour out my wrath on them— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my fierce anger. <br />The whole world will be consumed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the fire of my jealous anger. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22830">9</sup> “Then will I purify the lips of the peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that all of them may call on the name of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and serve him shoulder to shoulder. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22831">10</sup> From beyond the rivers of Cush<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22831b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my worshipers, my scattered people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will bring me offerings. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22832">11</sup> On that day you will not be put to shame <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all the wrongs you have done to me, <br />because I will remove from this city <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who rejoice in their pride. <br />Never again will you be haughty <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on my holy hill. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22833">12</sup> But I will leave within you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the meek and humble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who trust in the name of the LORD. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22834">13</sup> The remnant of Israel will do no wrong; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will speak no lies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will deceit be found in their mouths. <br />They will eat and lie down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one will make them afraid.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22835">14</sup> Sing, O Daughter of Zion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shout aloud, O Israel! <br />Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Daughter of Jerusalem! <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22836">15</sup> The LORD has taken away your punishment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has turned back your enemy. <br />The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never again will you fear any harm. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22837">16</sup> On that day they will say to Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not fear, O Zion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not let your hands hang limp. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22838">17</sup> The LORD your God is with you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is mighty to save. <br />He will take great delight in you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will quiet you with his love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will rejoice over you with singing.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22839">18</sup> “The sorrows for the appointed feasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remove from you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are a burden and a reproach to you.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22839c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22840">19</sup> At that time I will deal <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all who oppressed you; <br />I will rescue the lame <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gather those who have been scattered. <br />I will give them praise and honor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in every land where they were put to shame. <br /><sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22841">20</sup> At that time I will gather you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at that time I will bring you home. <br />I will give you honor and praise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among all the peoples of the earth <br />when I restore your fortunes<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22841d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before your very eyes,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-22829a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-22829" title="Go to Zephaniah 3:8">Zephaniah 3:8</a> Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew <i>will rise up to plunder</i></li>
