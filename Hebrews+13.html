<h4>Hebrews 13</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Concluding Exhortations</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30227">1</sup> Keep on
loving each other as brothers. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30228">2</sup> Do not forget to entertain strangers,
for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing
it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30229">3</sup> Remember
those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those
who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30230">4</sup>
Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure,
for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30231">5</sup> Keep your lives
free from the love of money and be content with what you have,
because God has said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Never will I leave you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never will I forsake you.”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30231a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30232">6</sup> So we
say with confidence,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lord is my helper; I will not be
afraid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can man do to me?”<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-30232b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30233">7</sup>
Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider
the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30234">8</sup> Jesus Christ is
the same yesterday and today and forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30235">9</sup> Do not
be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for
our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by ceremonial foods,
which are of no value to those who eat them. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-30236">10</sup> We have an altar from which those
who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30237">11</sup> The
high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place
as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30238">12</sup> And so Jesus
also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through
his own blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30239">13</sup>
Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he
bore. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30240">14</sup> For here
we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city
that is to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30241">15</sup>
Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a
sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that confess his name.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30242">16</sup> And do not
forget to do good and to share with others, for with such
sacrifices God is pleased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30243">17</sup> Obey
your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over
you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work
will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to
you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30244">18</sup> Pray
for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to
live honorably in every way. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-30245">19</sup> I particularly urge you to pray so that
I may be restored to you soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30246">20</sup> May
the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of
the sheep, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30247">21</sup>
equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work
in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30248">22</sup>
Brothers, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for I
have written you only a short letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30249">23</sup> I
want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he
arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30250">24</sup> Greet
all your leaders and all God’s people. Those from Italy send you
their greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-30251">25</sup> Grace
be with you all.</p>
