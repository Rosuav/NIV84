<h4>Ephesians 5</h4><p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29290">1</sup> Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29291">2</sup> and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29292">3</sup> But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29293">4</sup> Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29294">5</sup> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a man is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29294a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29295">6</sup> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29296">7</sup> Therefore do not be partners with them. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29297">8</sup> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29298">9</sup> (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29299">10</sup> and find out what pleases the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29300">11</sup> Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29301">12</sup> For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29302">13</sup> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29303">14</sup> for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wake up, O sleeper, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rise from the dead, <br />and Christ will shine on you.” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29304">15</sup> Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29305">16</sup> making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29306">17</sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29307">18</sup> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29308">19</sup> Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29309">20</sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29310">21</sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. <h5 class="passage-header">Wives and Husbands</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29311">22</sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29312">23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29313">24</sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29314">25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29315">26</sup> to make her holy, cleansing<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29315b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> her by the washing with water through the word, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29316">27</sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29317">28</sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29318">29</sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29319">30</sup> for we are members of his body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29320">31</sup> “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-29320c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29321">32</sup> This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-29322">33</sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-29294a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-29294" title="Ir a Ephesians 5:5">Ephesians 5:5</a> Or <i>kingdom of the Christ and God</i></li>
