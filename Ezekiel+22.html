<p><h4>Ezekiel 22</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Jerusalem’s Sins</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20978">1</sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20979">2</sup> “Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20980">3</sup> and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20981">4</sup> you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20982">5</sup> Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20983">6</sup> “‘See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20984">7</sup> In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20985">8</sup> You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20986">9</sup> In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20987">10</sup> In you are those who dishonor their fathers’ bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20988">11</sup> In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor’s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20989">12</sup> In you men accept bribes to shed blood; you take usury and excessive interest<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20989a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20990">13</sup> “‘I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20991">14</sup> Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20992">15</sup> I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20993">16</sup> When you have been defiled<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20993b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20994">17</sup> Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20995">18</sup> “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20996">19</sup> Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20997">20</sup> As men gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20998">21</sup> I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20999">22</sup> As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.’” <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21000">23</sup> Again the word of the LORD came to me: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21001">24</sup> “Son of man, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has had no rain or showers<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21001c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> in the day of wrath.’ <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21002">25</sup> There is a conspiracy of her princes<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-21002d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21003">26</sup> Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21004">27</sup> Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21005">28</sup> Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says’—when the LORD has not spoken. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21006">29</sup> The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien, denying them justice. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21007">30</sup> “I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-21008">31</sup> So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.” </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20989a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20989" title="Go to Ezekiel 22:12">Ezekiel 22:12</a> Or <i>usury and interest</i></li>
