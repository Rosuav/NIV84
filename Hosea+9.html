<h4>Hosea 9</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Punishment for Israel</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22210">1</sup> Do not
rejoice, O Israel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not be jubilant like the other nations.<br>
For you have been unfaithful to your God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you love the wages of a prostitute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at every threshing floor.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22211">2</sup> Threshing
floors and winepresses will not feed the people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new wine will fail them.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22212">3</sup> They will not
remain in the LORD’s land;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim will return to Egypt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and eat unclean<sup class='footnote'>[<a href=
"#fen-NIV1984-22212a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> food in
Assyria.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22213">4</sup> They will not
pour out wine offerings to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will their sacrifices please him.<br>
Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who eat them will be unclean.<br>
This food will be for themselves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will not come into the temple of the LORD.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22214">5</sup> What
will you do on the day of your appointed feasts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the festival days of the LORD?<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22215">6</sup> Even if they
escape from destruction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt will gather them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Memphis will bury them.<br>
Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thorns will overrun their tents.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22216">7</sup> The days of
punishment are coming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the days of reckoning are at hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Israel know this.<br>
Because your sins are so many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your hostility so great,<br>
the prophet is considered a fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inspired man a maniac.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22217">8</sup> The prophet,
along with my God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the watchman over Ephraim,<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-22217b" title=
"See footnote b">b</a>]</sup><br>
yet snares await him on all his paths,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hostility in the house of his God.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22218">9</sup> They have sunk
deep into corruption,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in the days of Gibeah.<br>
God will remember their wickedness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and punish them for their sins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22219">10</sup> “When
I found Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was like finding grapes in the desert;<br>
when I saw your fathers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig
tree.<br>
But when they came to Baal Peor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they consecrated themselves to that shameful
idol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and became as vile as the thing they loved.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22220">11</sup> Ephraim’s
glory will fly away like a bird—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22221">12</sup> Even if they
rear children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bereave them of every one.<br>
Woe to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I turn away from them!<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22222">13</sup> I have seen
Ephraim, like Tyre,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted in a pleasant place.<br>
But Ephraim will bring out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their children to the slayer.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22223">14</sup> Give
them, O LORD—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what will you give them?<br>
Give them wombs that miscarry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and breasts that are dry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22224">15</sup>
“Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hated them there.<br>
Because of their sinful deeds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will drive them out of my house.<br>
I will no longer love them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their leaders are rebellious.<br>
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22225">16</sup> Ephraim is
blighted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their root is withered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they yield no fruit.<br>
Even if they bear children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will slay their cherished offspring.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-22226">17</sup> My
God will reject them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have not obeyed him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be wanderers among the nations.</p>
