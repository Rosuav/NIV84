<p><h4>Ezekiel 1</h4><h5 class="passage-header">The Living Creatures and the Glory of the LORD</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20466">1</sup> In the<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20466a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20467">2</sup> On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20468">3</sup> the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20468b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20468c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> There the hand of the LORD was upon him. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20469">4</sup> I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20470">5</sup> and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20471">6</sup> but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20472">7</sup> Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20473">8</sup> Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20474">9</sup> and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20475">10</sup> Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20476">11</sup> Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20477">12</sup> Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20478">13</sup> The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20479">14</sup> The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20480">15</sup> As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20481">16</sup> This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20482">17</sup> As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20482d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> as the creatures went. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20483">18</sup> Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20484">19</sup> When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20485">20</sup> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20486">21</sup> When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20487">22</sup> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20488">23</sup> Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20489">24</sup> When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20489e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20490">25</sup> Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20491">26</sup> Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-20491f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20492">27</sup> I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-20493">28</sup> Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking. </p><div class="footnotes"><strong>Footnotes:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-20466a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-20466" title="Go to Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1:1</a> Or <i>my</i></li>
