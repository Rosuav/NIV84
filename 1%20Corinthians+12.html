<h4>1 Corinthians 12</h4><h5 class="passage-header">Spiritual Gifts</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28620">1</sup> Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28621">2</sup> You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28622">3</sup> Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28623">4</sup> There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28624">5</sup> There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28625">6</sup> There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28626">7</sup> Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28627">8</sup> To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28628">9</sup> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28629">10</sup> to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues,<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28629a" title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> and to still another the interpretation of tongues.<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28629b" title="Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28630">11</sup> All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. <h5 class="passage-header">One Body, Many Parts</h5>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28631">12</sup> The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28632">13</sup> For we were all baptized by<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28632c" title="Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28633">14</sup> Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28634">15</sup> If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28635">16</sup> And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28636">17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28637">18</sup> But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28638">19</sup> If they were all one part, where would the body be? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28639">20</sup> As it is, there are many parts, but one body. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28640">21</sup> The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28641">22</sup> On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28642">23</sup> and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28643">24</sup> while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28644">25</sup> so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28645">26</sup> If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. <p />&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28646">27</sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28647">28</sup> And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28648">29</sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28649">30</sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28649d" title="Vea nota al pie d">d</a>]</sup>? Do all interpret? <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-28650">31</sup> But eagerly desire<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-28650e" title="Vea nota al pie e">e</a>]</sup> the greater gifts.<h5 class="passage-header">Love</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I will show you the most excellent way. <div class="footnotes"><strong>Notas al pie:</strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-NIV1984-28629a"><a href="#en-NIV1984-28629" title="Ir a 1 Corinthians 12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</a> Or <i>languages</i>; also in verse 28</li>
