<h5 class="passage-header">Nehemiah’s Prayer</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12298">1</sup> The words
of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year,
while I was in the citadel of Susa, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12299">2</sup> Hanani, one of my brothers, came from
Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish
remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12300">3</sup> They
said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the
province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem
is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12301">4</sup> When I
heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned
and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12302">5</sup> Then I said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome
God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and
obey his commands, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12303">6</sup> let your ear be attentive and your eyes
open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and
night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins
we Israelites, including myself and my father’s house, have
committed against you. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12304">7</sup> We have acted very wickedly toward you.
We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your
servant Moses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12305">8</sup>
“Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If
you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12306">9</sup> but if you
return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people
are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and
bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my
Name.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12307">10</sup> “They
are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great
strength and your mighty hand. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12308">11</sup> O Lord, let your ear be attentive to
the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants
who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today
by granting him favor in the presence of this man.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was cupbearer to the king.</p>
