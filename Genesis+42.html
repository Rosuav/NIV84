<h4>Genesis 42</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1254">1</sup> When Jacob
learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do
you just keep looking at each other?” <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1255">2</sup> He continued, “I have heard that there is
grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may
live and not die.”
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1256">3</sup> Then
ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1257">4</sup> But Jacob did
not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he
was afraid that harm might come to him. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1258">5</sup> So Israel’s sons were among those who
went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan
also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1259">6</sup> Now
Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all
its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to
him with their faces to the ground. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1260">7</sup> As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he
recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke
harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to
buy food.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1261">8</sup>
Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize
him. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1262">9</sup> Then he
remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies!
You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1263">10</sup> “No,
my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1264">11</sup> We are all the
sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1265">12</sup> “No!”
he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is
unprotected.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1266">13</sup> But
they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one
man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our
father, and one is no more.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1267">14</sup> Joseph
said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies! <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1268">15</sup> And this is how you will
be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this
place unless your youngest brother comes here. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1269">16</sup> Send one of your number to
get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that
your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If
you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1270">17</sup> And he put them
all in custody for three days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1271">18</sup> On the
third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I
fear God: <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1272">19</sup> If
you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison,
while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving
households. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1273">20</sup> But
you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may
be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to
do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1274">21</sup> They
said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our
brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for
his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has
come upon us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1275">22</sup> Reuben
replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you
wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1276">23</sup> They did not
realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an
interpreter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1277">24</sup> He
turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and
spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before
their eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1278">25</sup> Joseph
gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver
back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey.
After this was done for them, <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1279">26</sup> they loaded their grain on their donkeys
and left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1280">27</sup> At the
place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack
to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of
his sack. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1281">28</sup> “My
silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in
my sack.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts sank and they turned to each
other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to
us?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1282">29</sup> When
they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told
him all that had happened to them. They said, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-1283">30</sup> “The man who is lord over the land
spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the
land. <sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1284">31</sup> But we
said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1285">32</sup> We were twelve brothers,
sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with
our father in Canaan.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1286">33</sup> “Then
the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will
know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here
with me, and take food for your starving households and go.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1287">34</sup> But bring your
youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but
honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can
trade<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1287a" title=
"Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> in the land.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1288">35</sup> As
they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his
pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches,
they were frightened. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-1289">36</sup> Their father Jacob said to them, “You
have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no
more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against
me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1290">37</sup> Then
Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if
I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will
bring him back.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-1291">38</sup> But
Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is
dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the
journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the
grave<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-1291b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> in sorrow.”</p>
