<h4>Ezra 5</h4>
<h5 class="passage-header">Tattenai’s Letter to Darius</h5>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12136">1</sup> Now
Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo,
prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the
God of Israel, who was over them. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12137">2</sup> Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and
Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in
Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12138">3</sup> At
that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and
Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, “Who
authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12139">4</sup> They also
asked, “What are the names of the men constructing this
building?”<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12139a"
title="Vea nota al pie a">a</a>]</sup> <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12140">5</sup> But the eye of their God was watching
over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a
report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12141">6</sup> This
is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates,
and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of
Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius. <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12142">7</sup> The report they sent him read as
follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To King Darius:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cordial greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12143">8</sup> The
king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the
temple of the great God. The people are building it with large
stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being
carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their
direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12144">9</sup> We
questioned the elders and asked them, “Who authorized you to
rebuild this temple and restore this structure?” <sup class=
"versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12145">10</sup> We also asked them their
names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for
your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12146">11</sup> This
is the answer they gave us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are the servants of the God of heaven and
earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years
ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.
<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12147">12</sup> But because
our fathers angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to
Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this
temple and deported the people to Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12148">13</sup>
“However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus
issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12149">14</sup> He even removed from the
temple<sup class='footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12149b" title=
"Vea nota al pie b">b</a>]</sup> of Babylon the gold and silver
articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from
the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple<sup class=
'footnote'>[<a href="#fen-NIV1984-12149c" title=
"Vea nota al pie c">c</a>]</sup> in Babylon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named
Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor, <sup class="versenum"
id="en-NIV1984-12150">15</sup> and he told him, ‘Take these
articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And
rebuild the house of God on its site.’ <sup class="versenum" id=
"en-NIV1984-12151">16</sup> So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the
foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the
present it has been under construction but is not yet
finished.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-NIV1984-12152">17</sup> Now
if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives
of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to
rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us
his decision in this matter.</p>
